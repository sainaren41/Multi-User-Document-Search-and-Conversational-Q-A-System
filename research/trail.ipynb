We report our estimates of the\\nnumbers of our daily active people (DAP) and average revenue per person (ARPP) (collectively, our \"Family metrics\") based on the activity of users who\\nvisited at least one of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp (collectively, our \"Family\" of products) during the applicable period of measurement.\\nWhile these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement, there are\\ninherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used to measure these\\nmetrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are continually seeking to improve our\\nestimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We regularly review our processes for\\ncalculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy, which can result in\\nadjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to\\napply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies or\\nadjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.\\nIn addition, our Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology or other factors such as\\ndata limitations or other challenges in measuring large online and mobile populations. For example, our methodologies include measurements of our user base\\nthat have in some instances exceeded estimates of addressable online and mobile populations that are based on data published by third parties.\\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual\\nproduct. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not\\nreflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook,\\nInstagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex\\ntechniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user\\naccounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of\\naccounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are\\nsubject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data as described further\\nbelow, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such\\nmargin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide DAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across\\nproducts to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates,\\npotentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do\\nnot match actual changes or trends.\\nTo calculate our estimates of DAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples\\nof user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example,\\nto match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and user\\nnames. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which survey questions are\\nbased on monthly usage, and which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the\\nfuture contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain\\ndetails of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different\\nproducts, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products,\\nwe have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with\\naccounts on our other products. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product\\ndecisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy\\n4'),\n",

Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies\\nevolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or\\nmachine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In\\naddition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of \"violating\" accounts. We define \"violating\"\\naccounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of\\n2024, we estimated that less than 3% of our worldwide DAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited\\nsample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and behaviors associated\\nwith Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to\\nencryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts\\nestimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make\\nproduct changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP estimates in a particular\\nperiod. We intend to continue to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis in our Annual\\nReport on Form 10-K. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary\\nsignificantly from our estimates.\\nUser Geography\\nOur estimates for revenue by user location, as well as year-over-year percentage changes in ad impressions delivered and the average price per ad by\\nuser location, are also affected by data limitations and other challenges in measuring user geography. Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is\\nestimated based on a number of factors, such as the user\\'s IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user\\'s\\nactual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing our products from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the\\nuser\\'s actual location. The methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors.\\n5'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'F:\\\\Multi-User Document Search and Conversational Q&A System\\\\data\\\\Meta\\\\Meta.pdf'}, page_content=\"Table of Contents\\nPART I\\nItem 1.Business\\nOverview\\nOur mission is to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.\\nWe build technology that helps people connect and share, find and build communities, and grow businesses. Our products enable people to connect and\\nshare with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) headsets, augmented reality (AR), and\\nwearables. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the world around them, enable people to share their experiences, ideas, photos,\\nvideos, and other content with audiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, and stay connected everywhere by\\naccessing our products. Meta is moving our offerings beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented, mixed, and virtual reality to help build\\nthe next computing platform. Our vision does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of experiences, devices, and new technologies.\\nWhile the metaverse is in the very early stages of its development, we believe it will become the next computing platform and the future of social interaction.\\nAcross our work, we are innovating in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to build new experiences that help make our platform more social, useful,\\nand immersive. Our AI investments support initiatives across our products and services, helping power the systems that rank content in our apps, our discovery\\nengine that recommends relevant content, the tools advertisers use to reach customers, the development of new generative AI experiences, and the tools that\\nmake our product development more efficient and productive. For example, Meta AI is an assistant that's available across our apps, on Ray-Ban Meta AI\\nglasses and on the web. It's designed to help people learn, get things done, create content, and connect with others to make the most of every moment.\\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate substantially all of our revenue from\\nselling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is reflected in FoA. Ads on our platform enable marketers to reach people across a\\nrange of marketing objectives, such as generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook,\\nInstagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software, and content.\\nWe invest in our business based on our company priorities. In 2025, we intend to focus on several key investment areas: generative AI, our discovery\\nengine, the metaverse and wearables, Threads, monetization of our products and services, platform integrity and community support, and infrastructure\\ncapacity.\\nThe majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2024, 79% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in\\nFoA and 21% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $75.25 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical\\ninfrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse and\\nwearables efforts. This includes developing virtual, mixed, and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other\\nfoundational technologies. Our total RL investments were $19.88 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount and technology development\\nacross these efforts. These are fundamentally new technologies that we expect will evolve as the next computing platform develops, and many products may\\nonly be fully realized in the next decade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the next computing platform will develop, we expect our\\nRL segment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our efforts to build the next computing platform is dependent\\non generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now\\nbecause we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around\\nadvertising, hardware, and digital goods.\\n6\"),\n",

Facebook helps give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together. It's a place for people to share life's\\nmoments and discuss what's happening, nurture and build relationships, discover and connect to people with shared interests, and create economic\\nopportunity. They can do this through Feed, Reels, Stories, Groups, Marketplace, and more.\\n• Instagram. Instagram brings people closer to the people and things they love. Instagram Feed, Stories, Reels, Live, and messaging are places\\nwhere people and creators can connect and express themselves through photos, video, and private messaging, and discover and shop from their\\nfavorite businesses.\\n• Messenger. Messenger is a simple yet powerful messaging application for people to connect with friends, family, communities, and businesses\\nacross platforms and devices through text, audio, and video calls.\\n• Threads. Threads is an application for text-based updates and public conversations, where communities come together to discuss topics of interest.\\nPeople can connect directly with their favorite creators and others who love the same things or build a loyal following of their own to share their\\nideas, opinions, and creativity with the world.\\n• WhatsApp. WhatsApp is a simple, reliable, and secure messaging application that is used by people and businesses around the world to\\ncommunicate and transact in a private way. Within WhatsApp we launched WhatsApp Channels, a one-to-many broadcast service designed to help\\npeople follow information from people and organizations that are important to them.\\nReality Labs Products\\nMany of our Reality Labs investments are directed toward long-term, cutting edge research and development for products that are not on the market\\ntoday and may only be fully realized in the next decade. This includes exploring new technologies such as neural interfaces using electromyography, which lets\\npeople control their devices using neuromuscular signals, as well as innovations in AI and hardware to help build next-generation interfaces. In the near term,\\nwe are continuing to develop early metaverse and wearables products and experiences that help people feel connected, anytime, anywhere.\\nOur metaverse efforts include our VR, MR, and social platform initiatives. Our current product offerings in VR include our Meta Quest devices, as well\\nas software and content available through the Meta Horizon Store, which enable a range of social experiences that allow people to defy physical distance while\\nengaging in gaming, fitness, entertainment, and more. To drive greater adoption and acceptance of VR we have introduced MR capabilities, which allow users\\nto experience the immersion and presence of VR while still being grounded in the physical world, through our Meta Quest devices.\\nOur wearables efforts include our AR initiatives. We have continued to advance our roadmap to include additional AI-enabled offerings such as the Ray-\\nBan Meta AI glasses, which feature Meta AI, our advanced conversational assistant, as well as other features such as hands-free interaction. As we continue our\\nlong-term efforts to bring AR glasses to market, in 2024 we also unveiled our Orion prototype, a pair of true AR glasses that overlay content on top of the\\nphysical world. It does this with an industry-leading field of view and in glasses form factor for comfortable wear.\\nIn general, while all of these investments are part of our long-term initiative to help build the next computing platform, our metaverse efforts also\\ninclude notable shorter-term projects developing specific products and services to go to market, whereas our wearables efforts are primarily directed toward\\nlonger-term research and development projects. For example, in 2025, we expect to spend approximately 50% of our Reality Labs operating expenses on our\\nwearables initiatives, and the remaining 50% on our metaverse initiatives. We apply significant judgment in estimating this expense breakdown as there are\\ncertain shared costs across product lines, and our expectations are subject to change, including as the next computing platform and our business strategies\\nevolve. In particular, we regularly evaluate our product roadmaps and make significant changes as our understanding of the technological challenges and\\nmarket landscape and our product ideas and designs evolve.\\n7\"),\n",

We compete with companies providing connection, sharing,\\ndiscovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or\\ndevelop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face significant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but\\nnot limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate, and discover content and information online or enable marketers to\\nreach their existing or prospective audiences. We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our products, to attract and retain businesses that use\\nour free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling applications that integrate with our products. We\\nalso compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and augmented, mixed, and virtual reality products and services. We also expect to\\nface additional competition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as other companies introduce new products and\\nservices, including as part of efforts to innovate through the development and application of AI and other new technologies as well as efforts to develop the\\nmetaverse.\\nTechnology\\nOur product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design, which means that\\nour products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience. As our user base grows, as engagement with\\nproducts like video, VR, and MR increases, and as we deepen our investment in new technologies, our computing needs continue to expand. We have designed\\nand built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure, and a substantial portion of our technical infrastructure is also provided by third\\nparties. Our ability to provide and continue to innovate our products and services depends on the continued availability of components, power, and network\\ncapacity.\\nWe make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones, as well as for our marketers\\nand developers. We are also investing in protecting the security, privacy, and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen\\nour systems against abuse. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things,\\nrecommend relevant content across our products through our AI-powered discovery engine, enhance our advertising tools and improve our ad delivery,\\ntargeting, and measurement capabilities, and to develop new products as well as new features for existing products.\\nWe also believe in the power of open source innovation and have released our Llama models, consisting of state-of-the-art foundation models that are\\navailable for researchers and developers to use and build upon. By making our Llama models openly available, we aim to accelerate AI research and\\ndevelopment, improve our own products, and to foster collaboration and innovation within the broader tech community.\\nSales and Operations\\nThe majority of our marketers use our self-service ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns. We also have a global sales force that\\nis focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from pre-purchase decision-\\nmaking to real-time optimizations to post-campaign analytics. We work directly with these advertisers, as well as through advertising agencies and resellers.\\nWe operate offices in more than 90 cities around the globe, the majority of which have a sales presence. We also invest in and rely on self-service tools to\\nprovide direct customer support to our users and partners.\\nFor our RL products, our sales and operations efforts utilize third-party sales channels such as retailers, resellers, and our direct-to-consumer channel,\\nMeta.com. These efforts are focused on driving consumer and enterprise sales and adoption of our Meta Quest portfolio of products and Ray-Ban Meta AI\\nglasses.\\nMarketing\\nHistorically, our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with them, supported by internal efforts to\\nstimulate awareness and interest. In addition, we have invested and will continue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help\\nbuild community around the world.\\n8'),\n",

In addition, to further protect our proprietary rights, from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties.\\nWe do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the\\nduration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products.\\nGovernment Regulation\\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, many of which are still\\nevolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations involve matters including\\nprivacy, data use, data combination, data protection and personal information, the provision of our services to younger users, biometrics, encryption, rights of\\npublicity, content, integrity, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, data localization and storage,\\ndata disclosure, AI and machine learning, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, civil rights,\\naccessibility, telecommunications, product liability, e-commerce, taxation, economic or other trade controls including sanctions, anti-corruption and political\\nlaw compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction of new products, expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions,\\nor other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws, regulations, or other government scrutiny. In addition, these U.S. and foreign laws and\\nregulations may impose different obligations from each other and create the potential for significant fines to be imposed.\\nThese U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to\\ngovernment entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws\\nand regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\\ninconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or\\nlitigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in\\nvarious ways, including for advertising, or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products, have in the past and could in the future\\nadversely affect user growth and engagement, affect the manner in which we provide our services, or adversely affect our financial results, including by\\nimposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global revenue. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral\\nargument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (Section 230)\\nwas at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. In addition, there have been, and continue to be, various other litigation\\nconcerning, and state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the scope of the protections available to online platforms under\\nSection 230, and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products, business practices, or operations, which could\\nadversely affect our business and financial results.\\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain\\ndata that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services.\\nIf we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products\\nand services, it could affect our ability to provide our services, the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely\\naffect our financial results. For example, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European\\nUnion to the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union\\n(CJEU). In addition, the other bases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to\\nregulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United\\nStates following a challenge brought by the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, on May\\n12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland's reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic\\nArea (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The IDPC issued an administrative fine\\nof EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to suspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into\\ncompliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including storage,\\n9\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'F:\\\\Multi-User Document Search and Conversational Q&A System\\\\data\\\\Meta\\\\Meta.pdf'}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nof such data in the United States. We are appealing this Final Decision and it is currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish High Court. Separately, on\\nMarch 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework\\n(EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities\\n(E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney General\\nas a \"qualifying state\" under Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the United\\nStates. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union\\nto organizations in the United States that are included in the \"Data Privacy Framework List,\" maintained and made publicly available by the United States\\nDepartment of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF. The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and welcome\\nmilestones, and we have implemented steps to comply with the above corrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. The EU-U.S. DPF replaces two\\nprior adequacy frameworks which were invalidated by the CJEU. A further invalidation of the EU-U.S. DPF by the CJEU could create considerable uncertainty\\nand lead to us being unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services, including Facebook and Instagram, in Europe, which would\\nmaterially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or new legislation and regulations\\ncould significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements\\nunder the GDPR, and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead\\nEuropean Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation as well as other\\nrequirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the CJEU, and draft decisions in investigations\\nby the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR\\'s consistency mechanism, which may lead to significant changes\\nin the final outcome of such investigations. We also face potential enforcement from European privacy regulators other than the IDPC, including where those\\nregulators consider they must act urgently or where they believe their concerns relate only to data processing undertaken in their individual jurisdiction. As a\\nresult, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant\\nuncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our operations. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and\\nother countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related requirements on products and services offered to users in their\\nrespective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA), also establishes certain transparency\\nrules and creates certain data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to\\ncontrol the purposes for which their data is shared with third parties. Other states have proposed or enacted similar comprehensive privacy laws that afford\\nusers with similar data privacy rights and controls. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our\\nadvertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising\\nbusiness. Some states have also proposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the privacy rights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents\\nor guardians. Like comprehensive privacy laws, these laws are evolving and subject to interpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and\\nservices provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting our advertising business. In Europe, evolving interpretation of the\\nePrivacy Directive\\'s requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies may lead to regulators imposing specific measures in the future which\\ncould directly impact our use of such technologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and national implementation laws impose additional limitations on the\\nuse of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance. Changes to our products or business practices as a result of these\\nor similar developments have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, in response to regulatory\\ndevelopments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European\\nEconomic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no\\nads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR, Digital Markets\\nAct (DMA), and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings regarding the compliance of our\\n\"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July 2024, reflecting its preliminary view that our\\nmodel does not comply with such requirements, and indicated that it will conclude its investigation in March 2025. In addition, the European Data Protection\\nBoard has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have raised concerns regarding\\nour compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024, we began offering users in the European Union,\\nEuropean Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads,\\n10'),\n",

These or any similar developments in the future may negatively impact our\\nuser growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results.\\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state\\nlevel, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the European\\nUnion imposes restrictions and requirements on companies like ours, including in areas such as the combination of data across services, mergers and\\nacquisitions, and product design. The DMA also includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements are enforceable against designated\\ngatekeeper companies as of March 2024. The DMA has caused, and may in the future cause, us to incur significant compliance costs and make changes to our\\nproducts or business practices. The requirements under the DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or future\\nproposals to modify competition laws in a number of jurisdictions could have similar effects. Further, the Digital Services Act (DSA), which started to apply to\\nour business as of August 2023, imposes certain restrictions and requirements for our products and services, subjects us to increased compliance costs, and\\nincludes significant penalties for non-compliance. The interpretation and enforcement of the DMA and the DSA, as well as the imposition and amount of\\npenalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In addition, some countries, such as the UK, India, and Turkey, are considering or have\\npassed legislation implementing data protection requirements, new competition requirements, or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar\\nrequirements that could require substantial changes to our products, increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering\\nof our products and services in certain countries, and/or result in fines or other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions may restrict our ability to\\ncollect and use information about minors or also limit our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions. For\\nexample, several U.S. states, including Arkansas, Utah, Texas, California, and Florida, among others, have passed laws restricting our ability to offer services to\\nminors without parental consent or otherwise limiting the services that we can provide to minors. While enforcement of a number of these statutes (or parts of\\nthem) has been enjoined as a result of legal challenges to them, it is possible that the decisions to enjoin these statutes may be overturned, the injunctive orders\\nmay expire, and certain statutes are coming into effect that may not be subject to injunctions. Should enforcement of one or more of these statutes not be\\nenjoined, we may not be able to comply with certain of these statutes by their respective effective dates. We may face similar challenges in light of recent\\nlegislation in Australia which imposes a social media ban for users under 16 years old that is expected to be effective by December 2025, requiring certain\\nsocial media companies to take reasonable steps to ensure under 16 year olds do not create user accounts. Legislative proposals and evolving interpretation of\\nexisting laws in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and other jurisdictions may also subject us to new requirements relating to allegedly fraudulent or illegal activities by\\nthird parties on our platform, which could cause us to incur significant compliance costs or make changes to our products or business practices, and could\\nsubject us to additional fines and penalties or liability for losses to users or other third parties in such transactions.\\nWe are and expect to continue to be, the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by government\\nauthorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data use, data combination, and data\\nprotection, including with respect to processing of sensitive data, data from third parties, data for advertising purposes, data security, minors, data subject\\nrights, safety, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content and content moderation, use of our platform for illegal, illicit, or otherwise\\nobjectionable activity, competition, AI, and machine learning. We are also currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees,\\nincluding the modified consent order we entered into with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which took effect in April 2020 and, among other things,\\nrequired us to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The FTC also continues to monitor us and our\\ncompliance with the modified consent order and initiated an administrative proceeding against us, which we are challenging at the agency and in federal court,\\nthat alleges deficient compliance and violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade\\nCommission Act and seeks changes to our business. If we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC's action and the agency imposes its proposed order in its\\ncurrent form, we would be subject to significant limitations, including on our ability to launch new and modified products or use data of users under 18 years\\nold. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us\\nto civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our\\nbusiness practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data practices), result in negative publicity and\\nreputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that\\nadversely affect our business.\\n11\"),\n",

Our financial performance has been\\nand will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding, retaining, and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions,\\nparticularly for Facebook and Instagram. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user\\nbase in one or more markets from time to time, particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates. User growth and engagement are also\\nimpacted by a number of other factors, including competitive products and services, such as TikTok, that have reduced some users' engagement with our\\nproducts and services, as well as global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic led to\\nincreases and decreases in the size and engagement of our active user base from period to period at different points during the pandemic. In addition, in\\nconnection with the war in Ukraine, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and these services were then prohibited by the Russian\\ngovernment, which contributed to slight decreases in the size of our active user base following the onset of the war. Any future declines in the size of our active\\nuser base may adversely impact our ability to deliver ad impressions and, in turn, our financial performance.\\nIf people do not perceive our products to be useful, reliable, and trustworthy, we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or\\nincrease the frequency and duration of their engagement. A number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their\\nactive user bases or levels of engagement decline, in some cases precipitously. There is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active\\nuser base or engagement levels.

For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and U.S. state privacy laws, including the\\nCCPA, have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen increases in the\\nnumber of users opting to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe following product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy\\nDirective compliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA. Other\\nU.S. state privacy laws, such as the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, and the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act, are introducing\\nadditional rights for users and could result in restrictions on our use of signals from third-party apps and websites through certain browser- and device-based\\nuniversal opt-out mechanisms. Judicial and regulatory guidance, decisions, or enforcement actions, or new legislation in these or other jurisdictions may\\nrequire us to make additional changes to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past. For\\nexample, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and\\nInstagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began\\noffering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with\\nrequirements under the GDPR, DMA, and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings regarding\\nthe compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July 2024. In addition, the\\nEuropean Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have\\nraised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024, we began offering users in\\nthe European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less\\npersonalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings.\\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or announced future\\nplans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple\\nmade certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers\\'\\nability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers\\nare willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users\\nthe ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services, including changes implemented in\\nconnection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and other regulatory frameworks.\\nThese developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising\\nrevenue. For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS\\nchanges beginning in 2021. If we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilities\\nwill be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our advertising revenue.\\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies,\\nproducts, and standards that we do not control.\\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices.

We are dependent on the interoperability\\nof our products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the Android and iOS\\noperating systems and mobile browsers. Changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system\\npartners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in the content or application of their terms of service or policies (which they have\\nmade in the past and continue to seek to implement) that degrade our products\\' functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products,\\ngive preferential treatment to\\n19'),\n",

For example,\\nApple previously released an update to its Safari browser that limits the use of third-party cookies, which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to\\nour users and impacts monetization, and also released changes to iOS that limit our ability to target and measure ads effectively, while expanding their own\\nadvertising business. In addition, Google previously proposed phasing out third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. We expect that any similar changes to\\nApple's, Google's, or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization.\\nAdditionally, in order to deliver high quality mobile products, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, products,\\nsystems, networks, and standards that we do not control, and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, and browser\\ndevelopers.

We may introduce significant\\nchanges to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which we have little or no prior\\ndevelopment or operating experience. For example, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed\\nreality technology, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these evolving products and technologies. We are also making\\nsignificant investments in artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives across our business. For example, we continue to launch new AI features on our products,\\nincluding support for new modalities, conversational AIs, stickers and photos, and editing tools. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may not be\\nsuccessful in generating profits, in connection with these efforts.\\nIn addition, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, significant resources in growing our messaging products to support increasing usage of\\nsuch products. We have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion, and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue\\nor profits from messaging over the long term. Our efforts to implement default end-to-end encryption across our messaging services on Facebook and\\nInstagram have been subject to governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions. For example, the Nevada Attorney General is seeking to enjoin\\nour offering of default end-to-end encryption on Messenger for all Nevada residents under the age of 18.\\nIf our new products or changes to existing products fail to engage users, marketers, or developers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail\\nto attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely\\naffected.\\nWe may not be successful in our artificial intelligence initiatives, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\\nWe are making significant investments in AI initiatives, including generative AI, to, among other things, recommend relevant content across our\\nproducts, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products. In particular, we expect our AI initiatives will\\nrequire increased investment in infrastructure and headcount.

We may not always be able to\\nanticipate how courts and regulators will apply existing laws to AI, predict how new legal frameworks will develop to address AI, or otherwise respond to these\\nframeworks as they are still rapidly evolving. We may also have to expend resources to adapt to new legal frameworks, and adjust our offerings in certain\\njurisdictions if the legal frameworks on AI are not consistent across jurisdictions.\\nFurther, we face significant competition from other companies that are developing their own AI features and technologies. Other companies may\\ndevelop AI features and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or are more cost-effective to develop and deploy. Given the long history of\\ndevelopment in the AI sector, other parties may have (or in the future may obtain) patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit, or interfere with\\nour ability to make, use, or sell our own AI features. Our AI initiatives also depend on our access to data to effectively train our models. Further, our ability to\\ncontinue to develop and effectively deploy AI technologies is dependent on access to specific third-party equipment and other technical and physical\\ninfrastructure, such as processing hardware, network capacity, computing power, and related energy requirements, as to which we cannot control the\\navailability or pricing, especially in a highly competitive environment.\\nWe are also developing AI technology that we make available via open source, commercial, and non-commercial license agreements to third-parties that\\ncan use this technology for use in their own products and services. We may not have insight into, or control over, the practices of third parties who may utilize\\nsuch AI technologies. As such, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not use such AI technologies for improper purposes, including through the\\ndissemination of illegal, inaccurate, defamatory or harmful content, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, furthering bias or discrimination,\\ncybersecurity attacks including spear phishing attacks, data privacy violations, other activities that threaten people\\'s safety or well-being on- or offline, or to\\ndevelop competing technologies. While we may mitigate certain risks associated with the improper use of our AI models through both technical measures and\\nthe inclusion of contractual restrictions on third-party use in any agreement between us and any third party, we cannot guarantee that such measures will be\\neffective. Such improper use by any third party could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results or subject us to legal liability.\\nIt is not possible to predict all of the risks related to the use of AI and changes in laws, rules, directives, and regulations or other regulatory developments\\nregarding the use of AI, including restrictions around the collection and use of data, may adversely affect our ability to develop and use AI or subject us to legal\\nliability.\\nWe make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect.\\nWe frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent\\nwith our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term.

Some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads, which\\nhas to some extent adversely affected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business.

From time to time, we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies. In addition, we\\nhave made, and we expect to continue to make, other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers,\\nand developers, and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products.

In addition, we have relatively limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual, augmented, and mixed\\nreality technology, which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development\\nefforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse\\ntechnologies, products, systems, networks, or standards. For example, some of our consumer hardware products depend on the ability to operate with third-\\nparty mobile platforms and these platforms do not necessarily provide our products with the same levels of interoperability that they provide to their own\\ncompeting products. In addition, our Reality Labs efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. We expect to\\ncontinue to make significant investments in virtual, augmented, and mixed reality and other technologies to support these efforts, and our ability to support\\nthese efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. In addition, as our Reality Labs efforts evolve, we may be subject to\\na variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, including in the areas of privacy, safety, AI, competition,\\ncontent regulation, tariffs, export controls, consumer protection, and e-commerce, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services,\\nincrease our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business.

We also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the\\nsharing of content on our services, or to practices by advertisers or developers, that are illegal, illicit, or in violation of our policies, or fail to otherwise enforce\\nour policies, address objectionable content or practices on our services, or address other user concerns, which has occurred in the past and which could erode\\nconfidence in our brands.\\nOur brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users, by the actions of users\\nacting under false or inauthentic identities, by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading (or intended to\\nmanipulate opinions), by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for security-related purposes or to censor certain\\ncontent on our platform, by the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around geopolitical\\nevents or elections in the United States and around the world, by decisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent\\nOversight Board, by research or media reports concerning the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user well-being, by our decisions\\nregarding whether to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who violate our community standards or terms of service, or by any\\nnegative sentiment associated with our management.\\nMaintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. Certain of our\\nactions, such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and\\nother content, as well as user well-being issues, have eroded confidence in our brands and may continue to do so in the future. If we fail to successfully\\npromote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business and financial results may be adversely affected.\\nWe may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with applications that integrate with our products.\\nWe have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build, grow, and monetize applications that integrate with our products.\\nSuch existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building, growing, or monetizing applications that create and maintain user engagement.\\nAdditionally, developers may choose to build on other platforms, including platforms controlled by third parties, rather than building products that integrate\\nwith our products. We are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience,\\nand we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers. For example, from time to time, we have taken actions\\nto reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on our products with the objective of enhancing the user experience, and such actions\\nhave reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization opportunities from, applications integrated with our products. In addition, as part\\nof our efforts related to privacy, safety, and security, we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time, and we also have\\nannounced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data. In some instances, these actions, as well as other actions to enforce our\\npolicies applicable to developers, have adversely affected, or will adversely affect, our relationships with developers. If we are not successful in our efforts to\\nmaintain or grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with our products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain\\ngood relations with such developers, our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected.\\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results\\nOur business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\\nWe compete with companies providing connection, sharing, discovery, and communication products and services to users online, as well as companies\\nthat sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers and/or develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. We face\\nsignificant competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, companies that facilitate the ability of users to create, share, communicate,\\nand discover content\\n23\"),\n",

We compete to attract, engage, and retain people who use our\\nproducts, to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services, and to attract and retain developers who build compelling\\napplications that integrate with our products. We also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and augmented, mixed, and virtual\\nreality products and services. We also expect to face additional competition as we introduce or acquire new products, as our existing products evolve, or as\\nother companies introduce new products and services, including as part of efforts to innovate through the development and application of AI and other new\\ntechnologies, as well as efforts to develop the metaverse.\\nSome of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources, experience, or stronger competitive positions in certain product segments,\\ngeographic regions, or user demographics than we do. For example, some of our competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political,\\nlegal, and regulatory regimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than\\nus to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some users, particularly younger users, are aware of and actively\\nengaging with other products and services similar to, or as a substitute for, our products and services, and we believe that some users have reduced their use of\\nand engagement with our products and services in favor of these other products and services. In addition, from time to time we make updates to our products\\nand services to improve the user experience (including to help provide users with safe, positive, age-appropriate experiences), and these changes have had, and\\nmay in the future have, the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with our products and services. In the event that users\\nincreasingly engage with other products and services, we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly, in which\\ncase our business would likely be harmed.\\nOur competitors may develop products, features, or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching\\nand successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Some competitors may gain a competitive\\nadvantage against us in areas where we operate, including: by making acquisitions; by limiting our ability to deliver, target, or measure the effectiveness of ads;\\nby imposing fees or other charges related to our applications or our delivery of ads; by making access to our products more difficult or impossible; by making it\\nmore difficult to communicate with our users; by limiting the ability of our devices or products to interoperate with their popular platforms or products; or by\\nintegrating competing platforms, applications, or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems, search engines, browsers, or e-\\ncommerce platforms. For example, each of Apple and Google have integrated competitive products with iOS and Android, respectively. In addition, Apple has\\nreleased changes to iOS that limit our ability, and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry, to target and measure ads effectively. As a result, our\\ncompetitors may, and in some cases will, acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts, which would\\nnegatively affect our business and financial results. In addition, from time to time, we may take actions in response to competitive threats, but we cannot assure\\nyou that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results.\\nWe believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\\n• the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our products compared to our competitors' products;\\n• the size and composition of our user base;\\n• the engagement of users with our products and competing products;\\n• our ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services;\\n• the timing and market acceptance of products, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors' products;\\n• our safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their data;\\n• our ability to distribute our products to new and existing users;\\n• our ability to monetize our products;\\n• the frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;\\n24\"),\n",

Our reputation has been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by unfavorable\\npublicity regarding, for example, our privacy practices, advertising policies, product decisions, product quality, litigation or regulatory activity, government\\nsurveillance, the actions of our advertisers, the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products, the use of our products or services\\nfor illicit or objectionable ends, the substance or enforcement of our community standards, terms of service, or other policies, the actions of our users, the\\nquality and integrity of content shared on our platform, the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user well-being, our management, or the\\nactions of other companies that provide similar services to ours. For example, we have been the subject of significant media coverage involving concerns\\naround our handling of political speech and advertising, hate speech, and other content, as well as user well-being issues, and we continue to receive negative\\npublicity related to these topics. Beginning in September 2021, we became the subject of significant media coverage as a result of allegations and the release of\\ninternal company documents by a former employee. In addition, we have been, and may in the future be, subject to negative publicity in connection with our\\nhandling of misinformation and other illicit or objectionable use of our products or services, including in connection with geopolitical events and elections in\\nthe United States and around the world. Any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of our user base and\\nmarketer demand for advertising on our products, which could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results, and we have\\nexperienced such adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\\nWe are subject to the risk of catastrophic events and crises, which may have a significant adverse impact on our business and operations.\\nWe are subject to the risk of public health crises such as pandemics, earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, terrorism,\\ngeopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, power loss, cyber-attacks, and other catastrophic events and crises. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic\\npreviously significantly impacted our business and results of operations. In particular, the pandemic led to volatility in the demand for and pricing of our\\nadvertising services at various points throughout the pandemic, and we may experience similar effects in the future as a result of the pandemic or other\\ncatastrophic events. Such events also expose our business, operations, and workforce to a variety of other risks, including: volatility in the size of our user base\\nand user engagement; delays in product development or releases, or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer hardware, as a result of\\ninventory shortages, supply chain or labor shortages; significant volatility and disruption of global financial markets, which could cause fluctuations in\\ncurrency exchange rates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future; illnesses to key employees, or a significant portion of our workforce,\\nwhich may result in inefficiencies, delays, and disruptions in our business; and increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the\\nbasis for estimates used in our financial statements. Any of these developments may adversely affect our business, harm our reputation, or result in legal or\\nregulatory actions against us.\\nWe incur significant expenses in operating our business, and some of our investments, particularly our investments in our artificial intelligence initiatives\\nas well as Reality Labs, have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business\\nand financial performance will be harmed.\\nWe incur significant expenses in operating our business, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base, as\\nusers increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us, for example with respect to video, as we develop and implement\\nnew products, as we market new and existing products and promote our brands, as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure, as we continue to invest\\nin new and unproven technologies, including AI and machine learning, and as we continue our efforts to focus on privacy, safety, security, and content and\\nadvertising review and enforcement. We have previously undertaken cost reduction measures in light of a more challenging operating environment, which may\\nadversely affect these or other business initiatives, and some of these measures have involved, and may in the future involve, up-front charges and outlays of\\ncash to reduce certain longer-\\n27'),\n",

In addition, from time to time we are subject to settlements, judgments, fines, or other monetary penalties in connection with legal and\\nregulatory developments that may be material to our business. We are also continuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies, including\\nas part of our metaverse and wearables efforts. Some of these investments, particularly our significant investments in Reality Labs, have generated only limited\\nrevenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability, and we expect the adverse financial impact of such investments to continue for the foreseeable\\nfuture. For example, our investments in Reality Labs reduced our 2024 overall operating profit by approximately $17.73 billion, and we expect our Reality\\nLabs investments and operating losses to increase in 2025. If our investments are not successful longer-term, our business and financial performance will be\\nharmed.\\nOur business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption in our products and services\\ncould damage our reputation, result in a potential loss of users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results.\\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain, and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and services and our\\nunderlying technical infrastructure. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions in the availability or performance of our products and\\nservices from time to time. Our systems may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid\\nperformance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business. If our products or services are unavailable when users attempt to access them, or if they\\ndo not load as quickly as expected, users may not use our products or services as often in the future, or at all, and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted, any\\nof which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. We have experienced such issues to varying degrees from time to time. In addition, as\\nthe amount and types of information shared on our products continue to grow and evolve, as the usage patterns of our global community continue to evolve,\\nand as our internal operational demands continue to grow, especially with the deployment of AI technologies, we will need an increasing amount of technical\\ninfrastructure, including network capacity, computing power, and related energy requirements, to continue to satisfy our needs. Although we are making\\nsignificant investments in our technical infrastructure, it is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to\\naccommodate these increased demands or achieve our business objectives, which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenue. In\\naddition, our business may be subject to interruptions, delays, or failures resulting from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power\\nloss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, cyber-attacks, or other catastrophic events and crises. Global climate change could result in\\ncertain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Any such events may result in users being subject to service\\ndisruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services, which\\nmay adversely affect our financial results. We also have been, and may in the future be, subject to increased energy and/or other costs to maintain the\\navailability or performance of our products and services in connection with any such events.\\nA substantial portion of our technical infrastructure is provided by third parties. Any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers\\ncould harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business. Any financial or other difficulties these providers face\\nmay adversely affect our business, and we exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they\\nprovide. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, various challenges with the supply chain related to supporting our technical infrastructure.\\nAs a result, we have adjusted, and may continue to adjust in the future, our procurement practices to adapt to the evolving landscape. We may not be able to\\nsecure sufficient components, equipment, or services from third parties to satisfy our needs, or we may be required to procure such components, equipment, or\\nservices on unfavorable terms.\\nAny of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products or services, require unfavorable changes to\\nexisting products or services, delay the introduction of future products or services, or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nWe have experienced, and could experience in the future, difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure.\\nWe have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products, and we plan to\\ncontinue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers, subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems, and other projects.\\nThe infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world, including in developing regions that\\nexpose us to increased risks relating to anti-corruption compliance, trade compliance, and political challenges, among others.

Additional unanticipated\\ndelays or disruptions in the completion of these projects, including due to the availability of components, power or network capacity, or any shortage of labor\\nnecessary in building portions of such projects, challenges in obtaining required government or regulatory approvals, or other geopolitical challenges or actions\\nby governments, whether as a result of trade disputes or otherwise, may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions in the delivery\\nor degradation of the quality or reliability of our products and services, or impairment of assets on our balance sheet. For example, like others in our industry,\\nwe rely on certain third-party equipment and components for our technical infrastructure that are manufactured by a small number of third parties, often with\\nsignificant operations in a single region such as Asia. Any of the foregoing delays or disruptions, including actions by governments or geopolitical events such\\nas international conflicts, could result in tariffs, sanctions, export or import controls, and other measures that restrict international trade, could reduce or\\neliminate the ability of our suppliers, manufacturers, or other third-party providers to continue their operations to manufacture, or limit or eliminate our ability\\nto purchase, key components of our technical infrastructure.\\nIn addition, there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation, which may\\nonly become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment, that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs.\\nFurther, much of our technical infrastructure is located outside the United States, and action by a foreign government, or our response to such government\\naction, has resulted, and may result in the future, in the impairment of a portion of our technical infrastructure, which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the\\nquality or reliability of our products and lead to a negative user experience or increase our costs. Any of these events could adversely affect our business,\\nreputation, or financial results.\\nReal or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\\nThe numbers for our key metrics, which include our DAP and average revenue per person (ARPP), are calculated using internal company data based on\\nthe activity of user accounts. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of\\nmeasurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The\\nmethodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors. In addition, we are\\ncontinually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base, and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology. We\\nregularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve\\ntheir accuracy, which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics. Our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or\\nother factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments. We generally do not intend to update previously disclosed Family metrics\\nfor any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below.\\nIn addition, our Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology or other factors such as\\ndata limitations or other challenges in measuring large online and mobile populations. For example, our methodologies include measurements of our user base\\nthat have in some instances exceeded estimates of addressable online and mobile populations that are based on data published by third parties.\\nMany people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual\\nproduct. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not\\nreflect the actual size of our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of Facebook,\\nInstagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. To calculate these metrics, we rely upon complex\\ntechniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts, including by matching multiple user\\naccounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person, and counting such group of\\naccounts as one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject to data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are\\nsubject to statistical variances and uncertainties. We estimate the potential error in our Family metrics primarily based on user survey data as described further\\nbelow, which itself is subject to error as well. While we expect the error margin for our Family metrics to vary from period to period, we estimate that such\\nmargin generally will be approximately 3% of our worldwide DAP. At our scale, it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across\\nproducts to individual people, and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary\\n29'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'F:\\\\Multi-User Document Search and Conversational Q&A System\\\\data\\\\Meta\\\\Meta.pdf'}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nsignificantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. As a result, it is also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes or\\ntrends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends.\\nTo calculate our estimates of DAP, we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples\\nof user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. We apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example,\\nto match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, we use data signals such as similar device information, IP addresses, and user\\nnames. We also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products, which survey questions are\\nbased on monthly usage, and which are inherently subject to error. The timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed, and may in the\\nfuture contribute, to changes in our reported Family metrics from period to period. In addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain\\ndetails of our business and increase the risk of error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different\\nproducts, and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others. For example, as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products,\\nwe have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match WhatsApp user accounts with\\naccounts on our other products. Any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating Family metrics, whether as a result of our own product\\ndecisions, actions by third-party browser or mobile platforms, regulatory or legislative requirements, or other factors, also may impact the stability or accuracy\\nof our reported Family metrics, as well as our ability to report these metrics at all. Our estimates of Family metrics also may change as our methodologies\\nevolve, including through the application of new data signals or technologies, product changes, or other improvements in our user surveys, algorithms, or\\nmachine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users. In\\naddition, such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts (as defined below).\\nWe regularly evaluate our Family metrics to estimate the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of \"violating\" accounts. We define \"violating\"\\naccounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service, including bots and spam. In the fourth quarter of\\n2024, we estimated that less than 3% of our worldwide DAP consisted solely of violating accounts. Such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited\\nsample of accounts, and we apply significant judgment in making this determination. For example, we look for account information and behaviors associated\\nwith Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers, but we have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due to\\nencryption. In addition, if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts, we do not include such person in our violating accounts\\nestimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account. From time to time, we disable certain user accounts, make\\nproduct changes, or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP estimates in a particular\\nperiod. We intend to continue to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our DAP consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis in our Annual\\nReport on Form 10-K. Violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale, and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary\\nsignificantly from our estimates.\\nOther data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates a decline in\\nusage among younger users, this age data may be unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age.\\nAccordingly, our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete.\\nOur estimates for revenue by user location, as well as year-over-year percentage changes in ad impressions delivered and the average price per ad by\\nuser location, are also affected by data limitations and other challenges in measuring user geography. Our data regarding the geographic location of our users is\\nestimated based on a number of factors, such as the user\\'s IP address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user\\'s\\nactual location. For example, a user may appear to be accessing our products from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the\\nuser\\'s actual location.

The scale of our business and breadth of\\nour products create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users,\\nmarketers, developers, and other third parties, and maintaining information technology systems and internal controls and procedures that support the scale and\\ncomplexity of our business. To effectively manage our scale, we must maintain, and continue to adapt, our operational, financial, and management processes\\nand systems, manage our headcount and facilities, and effectively train and manage our personnel. Many of our personnel work remotely, which may lead to\\nchallenges in productivity and collaboration. In addition, from time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency and realign our\\nbusiness and strategic priorities. For example, in 2022 and 2023, we announced several initiatives, including restructurings, employee layoffs, and measures to\\nscale down our office facilities. These efforts also subject us to risks such as greater than anticipated costs, adverse effects on employee retention, and increased\\ndifficulty managing the scale and complexity of our business. For example, we could face delays or challenges with product development, other business and\\nstrategic initiatives, or legal and regulatory compliance, as well as other disruptions to our operations. As our organization continues to evolve, and we are\\nrequired to implement and adapt complex organizational management structures, we may find it difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture,\\nincluding our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. Any of these developments could negatively affect our business, reputation,\\nor financial results.\\nWe have significant international operations, which subject us to increased business, economic, and legal risks that could affect our financial results.\\nWe have significant international operations. We currently make our Family products available in a total of more than 100 different languages, and we\\nhave offices or data centers in approximately 40 different countries. We may enter new international regions where we have limited or no experience in\\nmarketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are generally available globally, but some or all of our products or functionality may not be\\navailable in certain regions due to legal and regulatory complexities. For example, several of our products are not generally available in China. We also\\noutsource certain operational functions to third parties globally. If we fail to deploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business\\nmay suffer.

We also must manage our obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to import and export controls, trade restrictions, and sanctions,\\nincluding regulations established by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control.

For\\nexample, the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had, and in the future may have, quality issues resulting from the design or\\nmanufacture of the products, or from the software used in the products. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other\\nmanufacturers or suppliers. Our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues, other failures to meet our customers'\\nexpectations, or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective.\\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware products, which subjects us to a\\nnumber of risks. The manufacturing of our consumer hardware products depends on a small number of third parties, often with significant operations in a\\nsingle region such as Asia. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, supply or labor shortages, strikes or other disruptions in logistics and the\\nsupply chain, which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations, product development, and sales. We could be negatively affected if\\nwe are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations\\n(whether due to financial difficulties, manufacturing or supply constraints, or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of\\nsuch arrangements with them. The manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by\\nmacroeconomic conditions, geopolitical challenges, trade disputes, or other actions by governments or non-state actors (including international conflicts,\\ntariffs, sanctions, export controls, and other measures that restrict international trade) that subject us to supply shortages, increased costs, or supply chain or\\nlogistics disruptions.\\nWe also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and certain company policies regarding\\nsourcing practices and standards on labor, trade compliance, health and safety, the environment, and business ethics, but we do not control them or their\\npractices and standards and have experienced violations of these requirements from time to time. If any supplier or business partner violates laws, fails to\\nimplement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws, or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical, corrupt, or non-compliant, we could\\nexperience supply chain disruptions, government action or fines, canceled orders, or damage to our reputation.\\n32\"),\n",

The demand for our products can also change significantly\\nbetween the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. While we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or\\nunderstocking consumer hardware products we may sell, from time to time we have experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and meeting the consumer\\ndemand for our products. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international regions, it may be\\ndifficult to establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition of certain\\ntypes of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not be returnable. Any one of the foregoing factors may\\nadversely affect our operating results.\\nWe are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming, and, if resolved adversely, could\\nharm our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\\nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits, many of which claim statutory\\ndamages and/or seek significant changes to our business operations, and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future.\\nBecause of the scale of our user, advertiser, and developer base, the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages\\neven if the alleged per-user or entity harm is small or non-existent. In addition, we have faced, currently face, and will continue to face additional class action\\nand other lawsuits based on claims related to advertising, antitrust, privacy, security, biometrics, content, algorithms, copyright, user well-being, employment,\\ncontingent workers, activities on our platform, consumer protection, or product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and\\nsoftware, including virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven. For example, we are currently the subject of multiple putative class\\naction suits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in\\nviolation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018; our acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well\\nas other alleged anticompetitive conduct; a former employee\\'s allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; the\\ndisclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021; and allegations that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size for advertisements,\\nresulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. We are also the subject of multiple lawsuits related to our alleged use of biometric technology, our\\nalleged recommendation of and/or failure to remove harmful content, information from third-party websites or apps via our business tools, our alleged use of\\ncopyright-protected content to train our AI models, and allegations that Facebook and Instagram cause \"social media addiction\" in users and allegations of\\nviolations of the Children\\'s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, and any\\nnegative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or undesirable changes to our products or business\\npractices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\\nThere can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases, and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a\\nsignificant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be\\nreversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which has\\noccurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.\\nWe plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions, which could impact our financial condition or results of operations and\\nmay adversely affect the price of our common stock.\\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary\\ncompanies, products, or technologies, and from time to time may enter into other strategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures. We may not be\\nable to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms, or at all,\\nincluding as a result of regulatory challenges. For example, we completed our divestiture of Giphy in 2023 following the United Kingdom Competition and\\nMarkets Authority\\'s order directing us to divest Giphy post-acquisition. In addition, although we were able to successfully complete the acquisition after\\nprevailing in federal court, the FTC sought to enjoin our proposed acquisition of Within Unlimited.

The incurrence of indebtedness also results in increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include\\ncovenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we\\nregularly grant restricted stock units to retain the employees of acquired companies, which could increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial results,\\nand result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any acquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users,\\nmarketers, developers, or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our Class A common stock.\\nWe may also discover liabilities, deficiencies, or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance,\\nwhich may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence\\nare dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives, as\\nwell as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or\\nother strategic transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant\\nadditional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing. Any of these\\nfactors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire.\\nThe integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that\\ndevelop products where we do not have prior experience, and we may not manage these processes successfully. We have made, and may in the future make,\\nsubstantial investments of resources to support our acquisitions, which can result in significant ongoing operating expenses and the diversion of resources and\\nmanagement attention from other areas of our business. We cannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the\\ncompanies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.\\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\\nOur tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements,\\nincluding the manner in which we operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations of our\\nintercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable to our business, including the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation\\nand certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as Meta. We are\\nsubject to regular review and audit by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken,\\nincluding our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could\\nincrease our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position, results of\\noperations, and cash flows. For example, in 2016 and 2018, the IRS issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in\\nconjunction with the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years. Although we disagree with the IRS's position and are litigating this issue, the ultimate\\nresolution is uncertain and, if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us, may adversely affect our financial results.\\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management, and there are\\nmany transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our\\nbusiness, and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although we believe that our provision for\\nincome taxes and estimates of our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial\\nstatements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\\n34\"),\n",

For example, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted in December 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate\\nfor the fourth quarter of 2017. The issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the Tax Act, or other executive or Congressional actions\\nin the United States or globally could materially increase our tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued\\nor such actions take effect, and in future periods. In addition, many countries have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have\\nenacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we\\noperate our business.\\nOver the last several years, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit\\nShifting Project that, if implemented, would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the\\ncountries in which we do business. A number of countries have enacted legislation to implement the OECD’s 15% global minimum tax regime. As additional\\njurisdictions enact legislation, transitional relief expires, and other provisions of the minimum tax legislation become effective, our effective tax rate and cash\\ntax payments could increase in future years. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various\\naspects of the current international tax rules under which we are taxed. These proposals include changes to the existing rules to calculate income tax, as well as\\nproposals to change or impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. For example, several jurisdictions have\\nproposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services, which include business activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces, and which apply to\\nour business. There are ongoing OECD negotiations that contemplate an alternative to these proposals, which may proliferate in the absence of multilateral\\nagreement.\\nThe European Commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides\\npreferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain member states, including Ireland, have provided illegal state\\naid in certain cases. These investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations.\\nDue to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described\\nabove could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed on our business, and harm our financial position,\\nresults of operations, and cash flows. Such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts\\nestimated and recorded in our financial statements.\\nGiven our levels of share-based compensation, our tax rate has in the past varied, and may in the future vary, significantly depending on our stock price.\\nThe tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation have in the past impacted, and may in the future impact, our effective tax rate,\\nsometimes significantly, from period to period. In periods in which our stock price varies from the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in that\\nperiod, we will recognize excess tax benefits or shortfalls that will impact our effective tax rate. For example, in 2024, excess tax benefits recognized from\\nshare-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by $3.22 billion and our effective income tax rate by five percentage points as compared to\\nthe tax rate without such benefits. In future periods in which our stock price varies in comparison to the grant price of the share-based compensation vesting in\\nthat period, our effective tax rate may be inversely impacted. The amount and value of share-based compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular\\nperiod will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share-based compensation on our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent on our stock price,\\nwhich we do not control, and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results.\\n35'),\n",

For example, user access to Facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in\\nChina, Iran, and North Korea. In addition, government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in\\nviolation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons, and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from\\ntime to time. For example, in 2020, Hong Kong adopted a National Security Law that provides authorities with the ability to obtain information, remove and\\nblock access to content, and suspend user services, and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted. Hong Kong\\nhas passed additional national security legislation in 2024. In addition, if we are required to or elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other\\noperations in Hong Kong as a result of the National Security Law or other legislation, our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected. In\\naddition, in connection with the war in Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, access to Facebook and Instagram was restricted in Russia and the services were\\nthen prohibited by the Russian government, which has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our revenue and business in the region.\\nIt is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell or deliver advertising, including in countries where access\\nto our consumer-facing products may be blocked or restricted. For example, we generate meaningful revenue from a small number of resellers serving\\nadvertisers based in China, and it is possible that the Chinese, United States, or other government could take action that reduces or eliminates our China-based\\nadvertising revenue, whether as a result of the trade dispute with the United States, including any tariffs implemented by the United States or China, in\\nresponse to content issues or information requests in Hong Kong or elsewhere, or for other reasons, or take other action against us, such as imposing taxes or\\nother penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results.\\nSimilarly, if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for companies in Turkey, the Turkish government could take action to\\nreduce or eliminate our Turkey-based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our products. In the event that content shown on Facebook or\\nour other products is subject to censorship, access to our products is restricted, in whole or in part, in one or more countries, we are required to or elect to make\\nchanges to our operations, or other restrictions are imposed on our products, or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or\\ncapture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions, our ability to retain or increase our user base,\\nuser engagement, or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated, and\\nour financial results could be adversely affected.\\n37'),\n",

In addition, these U.S. and foreign laws and\\nregulations may impose different obligations from each other and create the potential for significant fines to be imposed.\\nThese U.S. federal and state, EU, and other international laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to\\ngovernment entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws\\nand regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied\\ninconsistently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory or legislative actions or\\nlitigation concerning the manner in which we display content to our users, moderate content, provide our services to younger users, or are able to use data in\\nvarious ways, including for advertising, have in the past and could in the future adversely affect user growth and engagement, affect the manner in which we\\nprovide our services, or adversely affect our financial results, including by imposing significant fines that increasingly may be calculated based on global\\nrevenue.\\nWe are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances we can transfer, process or receive certain\\ndata that is critical to our operations, including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services.\\nFor example, in 2016, the European Union and United States agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union to the United States,\\ncalled the Privacy Shield, but the Privacy Shield was invalidated in July 2020 by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). In addition, the other\\nbases upon which Meta relies to transfer such data, such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For\\nexample, the CJEU considered the validity of SCCs as a basis to transfer user data from the European Union to the United States following a challenge brought\\nby the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC). Although the CJEU upheld the validity of SCCs in July 2020, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final\\nDecision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland’s reliance on SCCs in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was\\nnot in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to\\nsuspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including\\nstorage, of such data in the United States. We are appealing this Final Decision and it is currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish High Court.\\nOn March 25, 2022, the European Union and United States announced that they had reached an agreement in principle on a new EU-U.S. Data Privacy\\nFramework (EU-U.S. DPF). On October 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence\\nActivities (E.O.), and on June 30, 2023, the European Union and the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States\\nAttorney General as a “qualifying state” under Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation\\nto the United States. The adequacy decision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the\\nEuropean Union to organizations in the United States that are included in the “Data Privacy Framework List,” maintained and made publicly available by the\\nUnited States Department of Commerce pursuant to the EU-U.S. DPF. The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and\\nwelcome milestones, and we have implemented steps to comply with the above corrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. The EU-U.S. DPF\\nreplaces two prior adequacy frameworks which were invalidated by the CJEU. A further invalidation of the EU-U.S. DPF by the CJEU could create\\nconsiderable uncertainty and lead to us being unable to offer a\\n38'),\n",

If we are unable to transfer data between and among countries\\nand regions in which we operate, or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, it could affect our ability to provide our services,\\nthe manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results.\\nWe have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments, which together with proposed or new legislation and regulations\\ncould significantly affect our business in the future. For example, we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements\\nunder the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and may implement additional changes in the future. The GDPR also requires submission of\\npersonal data breach notifications to our lead European Union privacy regulator, the IDPC, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the\\nnotification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the\\nCJEU, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR\\'s consistency\\nmechanism, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. We also face potential enforcement from European privacy\\nregulators other than the IDPC, including where those regulators consider they must act urgently or where they believe their concerns relate only to data\\nprocessing undertaken in their individual jurisdiction. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of the GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of\\npenalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty, and as it evolves, could potentially have a negative impact on our business and/or our\\noperations. In addition, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacy-related\\nrequirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions. The California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California\\nPrivacy Rights Act (CCPA), also establishes certain transparency rules and creates certain data privacy rights for users, including limitations on our use of\\ncertain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control the purposes for which their data is shared with third parties. Other states have\\nproposed or enacted similar comprehensive privacy laws that afford users with similar data privacy rights and controls. These laws and regulations are evolving\\nand subject to interpretation, and resulting limitations on our advertising services, or reductions of advertising by marketers, have to some extent adversely\\naffected, and will continue to adversely affect, our advertising business. Some states have also proposed or enacted laws specifically focused on the privacy\\nrights and controls for users under 18 years old and their parents or guardians. Like comprehensive privacy laws, these laws are evolving and subject to\\ninterpretation, and may restrict our ability to offer certain products and services provided to all or certain cohorts of users in those states, adversely affecting\\nour advertising business. In Europe, evolving interpretation of the ePrivacy Directive\\'s requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies may\\nlead to regulators imposing specific measures in the future which could directly impact our use of such technologies. In addition, the ePrivacy Directive and\\nnational implementation laws impose additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and include significant penalties for non-compliance.\\nChanges to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, our\\nadvertising business. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising\\non Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023\\nwe began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding\\ncompliance with requirements under the GDPR, DMA, and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal\\nproceedings regarding the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July\\n2024. In addition, the European Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer\\nprotection organizations have raised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024,\\nwe began offering users in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported\\nby ads, an option to see less personalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings. These or any similar\\ndevelopments in the future may negatively impact our user growth and engagement, revenue, and financial results.\\nSimilarly, there are a number of legislative proposals or recently enacted laws in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state\\nlevel, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business. For example, the DMA in the European\\nUnion imposes restrictions and requirements on\\n39'),\n",

The DMA also includes\\nsignificant penalties for non-compliance, and its key requirements are enforceable against designated gatekeeper companies as of March 2024. The DMA has\\ncaused, and may in the future cause, us to incur significant compliance costs and make changes to our products or business practices. The requirements under\\nthe DMA will likely be subject to further interpretation and regulatory engagement. Pending or future proposals to modify competition laws in a number of\\njurisdictions could have similar effects. Further, the DSA, which started to apply to our business as of August 2023, imposes certain restrictions and\\nrequirements for our products and services, subjects us to increased compliance costs, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. The interpretation\\nand enforcement of the DMA and the DSA, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. In\\naddition, some countries, such as the UK, India, and Turkey, are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements, new\\ncompetition requirements, or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could require substantial changes to our products,\\nincrease the cost and complexity of delivering our services, cause us to cease the offering of our products and services in certain countries, and/or result in fines\\nor other penalties. New legislation or regulatory decisions may restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors or also limit our advertising\\nservices or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions. For example, several U.S. states, including Arkansas, Utah, Texas,\\nCalifornia, and Florida, among others, have passed laws restricting our ability to offer services to minors without parental consent or otherwise limiting the\\nservices that we can provide to minors. While enforcement of a number of these statutes (or parts of them) has been enjoined as a result of legal challenges to\\nthem, it is possible that the decisions to enjoin these statutes may be overturned, the injunctive orders may expire, and certain statutes are coming into effect\\nthat may not be subject to injunctions. Should enforcement of one or more of these statutes not be enjoined, we may not be able to comply with certain of these\\nstatutes by their respective effective dates. We may face similar challenges in light of recent legislation in Australia which imposes a social media ban for users\\nunder 16 years old that is expected to be effective by December 2025, requiring certain social media companies to take reasonable steps to ensure under 16 year\\nolds do not create user accounts. Legislative proposals and evolving interpretation of existing laws in Europe, Asia-Pacific, and other jurisdictions may also\\nsubject us to new requirements relating to allegedly fraudulent or illegal activities by third parties on our platform, which could cause us to incur significant\\ncompliance costs or make changes to our products or business practices, and could subject us to additional fines and penalties or liability for losses to users or\\nother third parties in such transactions. In addition, the Province of British Columbia has considered, and may in the future consider, a bill that would permit\\nthe government to recover public health-related costs potentially associated with providing goods and services in British Columbia, including potentially social\\nmedia services.\\nWe are also subject to disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements regarding our social and environmental risks and initiatives. There has been\\nincreased focus on these initiatives by many regulators, investors, and other stakeholders and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable\\nfederal, state, local or international laws and regulations could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially and adversely affect our\\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\\nThese laws and regulations, as well as any associated claims, inquiries, or investigations or any government actions, have led to, and may in the future\\nlead to, unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs, changes to our products, loss of revenue, delays or impediments in the development of\\nnew products, negative publicity and reputational harm, increased operating costs, diversion of management time and attention, and remedies that harm our\\nbusiness, including fines, damages, or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\\nWe have been and remain subject to regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and we expect to continue to be\\nsubject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices\\nin a manner materially adverse to our business.\\nWe receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations, many of\\nwhich are evolving and subject to interpretation. We are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for\\ninformation, actions, and audits in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data use, data combination, and data\\nprotection, including with respect to processing of sensitive data, data from third parties, data for advertising purposes, data security, minors, data subject\\nrights, safety, law enforcement, consumer protection, civil rights, content and content moderation, use of our platform for illegal, illicit, or otherwise\\nobjectionable activity, competition, AI, and machine learning. In addition, we are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent\\ndecrees. For example, data protection, competition, content, and consumer protection authorities in the European Union, United States, and other jurisdictions\\nhave initiated actions,\\n40'),\n",

In addition, we have been and continue to be the subject of litigation and investigations related to the ways in which we collect and use information,\\nincluding where advertisers are subject to additional regulation such as housing, employment, credit, and financial services. In addition, beginning in March\\n2018, we became subject to FTC, state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions in connection\\nwith our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms\\nand policies. In July 2019, we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and, among\\nother things, required us to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiries and\\nlitigation, and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. The FTC also continues to monitor us and our compliance with the modified\\nconsent order and initiated an administrative proceeding against us, which we are challenging at the agency and in federal court, that alleges deficient\\ncompliance and violations of the Children\\'s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the COPPA Rule, and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and\\nseeks changes to our business. If we are unsuccessful in our challenge to the FTC\\'s action and the agency imposes its proposed order in its current form, we\\nwould be subject to significant limitations, including on our ability to launch new and modified products or use data of users under 18 years old. We also notify\\nthe IDPC, our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, and other regulators of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, issue\\nsimilar notifications to European regulators under other laws (such as UK GDPR and Member State implementations of the ePrivacy Directive), and are\\nsubject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance. In addition, we are subject to\\ninquiries and investigations by the European Commission regarding our compliance with various provisions of the DSA relating to the use of Facebook and\\nInstagram, including matters related to elections, content reporting and appeals, third-party access to data, political content recommendations, potential\\ndeceptive advertising and disinformation, and minors and other vulnerable users. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to penalties, fines, and\\nrequirements to change our business practices as a result of such inquiries and investigations. In addition, in July 2024, we entered into a settlement to resolve a\\nlawsuit by the state of Texas in connection with the \"tag suggestions\" feature and other uses of facial recognition technology.\\nWe are also subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition authorities in the United States, Europe, and\\nother jurisdictions, which relate to many aspects of our business, including with respect to users and advertisers. Such inquiries, investigations, and lawsuits\\nconcern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services, messaging services, digital advertising, and/or\\nmobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, beginning in 2019, we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by\\nthe FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice. Beginning in 2020, we became subject to a lawsuit by the FTC alleging that we violated antitrust laws, including\\nby acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The complaint seeks a permanent injunction against our company\\'s alleged violations of the antitrust\\nlaws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. In addition, in November 2024, the European Commission\\nissued a fine as a result of its finding that we tied Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a manner that infringes European Union competition\\nrules. We are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning\\nin September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to allegations and the release of internal company documents by a\\nformer employee.\\nOrders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose\\nus to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our personnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change\\nour business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business (including changes to our products or user data practices), result in negative publicity and\\nreputational harm, divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that\\nadversely affect our business, and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time.\\nCompliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, U.S. state privacy laws, youth social media laws, the ePrivacy Directive, the DMA, the DSA, and other\\nregulatory and legislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our business practices, and any compliance\\nfailures may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, and financial results.\\nWe are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including in connection with our modified consent order with the FTC,\\nrequirements of the GDPR, and other current and anticipated regulatory and legislative\\n41'),\n",

In particular, we are maintaining a comprehensive privacy program in\\nconnection with the FTC consent order that includes substantial management and board of directors oversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting\\nobligations, prohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data, a process to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the\\nFTC, and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent third-party assessor, which has been and will continue to be challenging and costly to\\nmaintain and enhance. These compliance and oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources, and require significant new and ongoing\\ninvestments, including investments in compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure. We continually reallocate resources internally to assist\\nwith these efforts, and this has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our other business initiatives. In addition, these efforts require substantial\\nmodifications to our business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and costly. As a result,\\nwe believe our ability to develop and launch new features, products, and services in a timely manner has been and will continue to be adversely affected.\\nFurther, our privacy compliance and oversight efforts have required, and we expect will continue to require, significant time and attention from our\\nmanagement and board of directors. The requirements of the FTC consent order and other privacy-related laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly\\nto our business, and from time to time we notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these requirements or otherwise\\ndiscover privacy issues, and we expect to continue to do so as any such issues arise in the future. In addition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements\\nare constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation. For example, we are subject to restrictions and requirements under\\nthe DMA, including in areas such as the combination of data across services and product design, which will likely be subject to further interpretation and\\nregulatory engagement.\\nThe FTC initiated an administrative proceeding against us alleging, among other things, deficient compliance with the FTC consent order and seeking\\nsubstantial modifications to the requirements of the consent order, including a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to\\nthe composition of our board of directors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. We are challenging the FTC's\\nadministrative proceeding. If the challenge is unsuccessful and the FTC is able to impose the proposed order in its current form, it would limit our ability to\\nprovide certain features and services, engage in certain business practices, require us to further increase the time, resources, and costs we spend on compliance\\nand oversight efforts, and would adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nIf we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the FTC consent order (including any future modifications to the order),\\nGDPR, U.S. state privacy laws, youth social media laws, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, DSA, or other regulatory or legislative requirements, or if any relevant\\nauthority believes that we are in violation of the consent order or other applicable requirements, we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations\\nor lawsuits, which may result in significant monetary fines or damages (including for loss of control of data without other damage), judgments, penalties, or\\nother remedies, and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on\\nour business, reputation, and financial results.\\nWe may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims\\nrelated to our products, and legislation regulating content on our platform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely\\naffect our business and financial results.\\nWe have faced, currently face, and will continue to face claims and government and regulatory inquiries relating to information or content that is\\npublished or made available on our products, including claims, inquiries, and investigations relating to our policies, algorithms, and enforcement decisions with\\nrespect to such information or content. In particular, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation, dissemination of misinformation or\\nnews hoaxes, deceptive and fraudulent advertising, discrimination, harassment, intellectual property rights, rights of publicity and privacy, personal injury torts,\\nlaws regulating hate speech or other types of content, on- or offline safety and well-being (such as acts of violence, terrorism, improper promotion or\\ndistribution of pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs, human exploitation, child exploitation, illegal gaming, and other fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity),\\nproducts liability, consumer protection, and breach of contract, among others. For example, over the last several years we have seen an increase in claims\\nbrought by younger users related to well-being issues based on allegedly harmful content that is shared on or recommended by our products. In addition, we\\nhave been subject to litigation alleging that our ad targeting and delivery practices constitute violations of anti-discrimination laws.\\nThe potential risks relating to any of the foregoing types of claims are currently enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our\\nprotection from liability for third-party actions may be unclear or where we may be less\\n42\"),\n",

For example, in April 2019, the European Union passed a directive (the European Copyright\\nDirective) expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online, which the EU member states have\\nsince implemented into their national laws. In addition, the European Union revised the European Audiovisual Media Service Directive to apply to online\\nvideo-sharing platforms, which member states are implementing. Additionally, Brazil has an intermediary liability framework limiting liability for third-party\\ncontent, which has been challenged as unconstitutional and is under review by the Brazilian Supreme Court. In the United States, in 2023, the U.S. Supreme\\nCourt heard oral argument in a matter in which the scope of the protections available to online platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Decency\\nAct (Section 230) was at issue, but it ultimately declined to address Section 230 in its decision. There also have been, and continue to be, various other\\nlitigation concerning, and state and federal legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict, the scope of the protections under Section 230, as well as to\\nimpose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings, user access and content, including electoral-related and AI-generated content,\\ncounterfeit goods and copyright-infringing material, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or\\nchange. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if we are found liable, significant damages.\\nWe could also face fines, orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other judicial or government-imposed remedies as a\\nresult of content hosted on our services. For example, legislation in Germany and India has resulted, and may result in the future, in the imposition of fines or\\nother penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure obligations. Numerous other countries in\\nEurope, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing liability or potentially significant\\npenalties, including fines, service throttling, or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes. For example, we\\nhave been subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in Turkey, and we have been subject to\\nfines and service blocking and prohibition in Russia. Content-related legislation also has required us, and may require us in the future, to change our products\\nor business practices, increase our costs, or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies. For example, the\\nEuropean Copyright Directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent the\\navailability of that content, which may require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes. Member states' laws implementing the European\\nCopyright Directive may also require online platforms to pay for content. In addition, our products and services are subject to restrictions and requirements,\\nand we are subject to increased compliance costs, and potential fines or other penalties in the event of non-compliance, as a result of the Digital Services Act in\\nthe European Union, which started to apply to our business as of August 2023, and other content-related legislative developments such as the Online Safety and\\nMedia Regulation Act in Ireland and the Online Safety Act in the United Kingdom. Certain countries have also implemented or proposed legislation that may\\nrequire us to pay publishers for certain news content shared on our products. For example, as a result of such legislation in Canada, we have ended the\\navailability of news content for Canadian users on Facebook and Instagram. In the United States, changes to the protections available under Section 230 or the\\nFirst Amendment to the U.S. Constitution or new state or federal content-related legislation or investigations may increase our costs or require significant\\nchanges to our products, business practices, or operations, which could adversely affect user growth and engagement.\\nAny of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nPayment-related activities may subject us to additional regulatory requirements, regulatory actions, and other risks that could be costly and difficult to\\ncomply with or that could harm our business.\\nSeveral of our products offer Payments functionality, including enabling our users to purchase tangible, virtual, and digital goods from merchants and\\ndevelopers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure, send money to other users, and make donations to certain charitable organizations, among\\nother activities. We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing anti-money\\nlaundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, stored value, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, virtual\\ncurrency, consumer protection, charitable fundraising, economic sanctions, and import and export restrictions. In addition, we could become subject to new\\nconsumer protection laws and regulations that may be adopted or amended, including those related to payments activity as well as sharing, collection, and use\\nof payments-related data. For example, the CFPB issued its anticipated Larger Participant Rule, effective January 2025, allowing the CFPB to conduct\\nsupervisory activities over general-use digital consumer payment applications. The Rule, which is under legal challenge by a trade association, could subject\\ncertain of our payments products to this authority. Depending on how our Payments products evolve, we may also be subject to other laws and regulations\\nincluding those governing gambling, banking, and lending. In some jurisdictions, the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear. We\\nhave received certain\\n43\"),\n",

These\\nlicenses increase flexibility in how our use of Payments may evolve, help mitigate regulatory uncertainty, and will generally require us to demonstrate\\ncompliance with many domestic and foreign laws in relation to our regulated Payments products and activities. Our efforts to comply with these laws and\\nregulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and attention and may still not guarantee compliance. In the event that we are found to\\nbe in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order, or we may\\nbe required to make product changes, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of Payments transactions, including: increased costs and diversion of management\\ntime and attention and other resources to address bad transactions or customer disputes; potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users, developers,\\nemployees, or third parties; restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact Payments; and additional disclosure and reporting requirements.\\nWe have also launched payments functionality on certain of our applications and may in the future undertake additional payments initiatives, including as part\\nof our metaverse efforts, which may subject us to many of the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements.\\nRisks Related to Data, Security, Platform Integrity, and Intellectual Property\\nSecurity breaches, improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems, or other cyber incidents\\ncould harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\\nOur industry is prone to cyber-attacks by parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users' data or to disrupt our ability to provide service or\\notherwise harm us. Our products and services involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data. Any failure to prevent or\\nmitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data, including personal information, content, or payment information from\\nusers, or information from marketers, could result in the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, or other misuse of such data, which could harm our\\nbusiness and reputation and diminish our competitive position. In addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (such as spear phishing attacks),\\nscraping, and general hacking continue to be prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems, and will occur on our systems in the future. We also\\nregularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts, purchase ads, or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming,\\nspreading misinformation, or other illegal, illicit, or otherwise objectionable ends. As a result of our prominence, the size of our user base, the types and\\nvolume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services (including our efforts involving new and emerging\\ntechnologies), we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks, including from nation states and highly sophisticated, state-\\nsponsored, or otherwise well-funded actors, and we experience heightened risk from time to time as a result of geopolitical events. Our efforts to address\\nundesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks. Such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide,\\ndegrade the user experience or otherwise adversely affect users, cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products, impair our internal\\nsystems, or result in financial harm to us. Our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive, and to prevent or disable undesirable activities\\non our platform, may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs, misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, or other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, or\\nvendor error or malfeasance; social engineering or other cyber-attacks directed towards our personnel or their access; misuse of company data or systems by\\nour personnel; defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors' information technology systems or offerings; government exploitation or surveillance; breaches of\\nphysical security of our facilities, technical infrastructure, or other equipment; or other threats that evolve. In addition, other parties may attempt to fraudulently\\nor maliciously induce employees, contractors, vendors, or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users' data. Cyber-attacks\\ncontinue to evolve in sophistication and volume, and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time. Although we have developed systems and\\nprocesses that are designed to protect our data and user data, to reduce the risk of data loss or misuse, to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our\\nplatform, and to reduce the risk of or detect security breaches, such measures will not provide absolute security, and we cannot assure you that we will be able\\nto react in a timely manner to any cyber-attacks or other security incidents, or that our remediation efforts will be successful. Our business and operations span\\nnumerous geographies around the world and involve thousands of employees, contractors, vendors, developers, partners, and other third parties. At any given\\ntime, we face known and unknown cybersecurity risks and threats that are not fully mitigated, and we discover vulnerabilities in our security efforts.\\nIn addition, some of our developers or other partners, such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads, may receive or store information\\nprovided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with our products.\\n44\"),\n",

From time to time we are unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise prevent or remediate any such incidents. We\\nmay also be subject to increased risk as a result of changes to our content policies and enforcement efforts which we began to implement in January 2025 to\\nfurther free expression on our platform and mitigate over-enforcement of certain of our content policies.\\nConsequences of any of the foregoing developments include negative effects on user trust and engagement, harm to our reputation and brands, changes\\nto our business practices in a manner adverse to our business, and adverse effects on our business and financial results. Such developments have subjected, and\\nmay in the future subject, us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages, divert management's\\ntime and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight.\\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical, and any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities in these systems, or\\nfailures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems, could adversely affect our business.\\nOur products and internal systems rely on software and hardware, including software and hardware developed or maintained internally and/or by third\\nparties (including open source software and the operating systems and browsers which users rely on to run our applications and access our systems), that is\\nhighly technical and complex.

For example, we make commitments to our users as to how their data will be collected, used, shared, and retained within and across our products, and\\nour systems are subject to errors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably. In addition, any errors, bugs,\\nvulnerabilities, or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely, failures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our\\nsystems, or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users, have led to, and may in the future lead to,\\noutcomes including damage to our reputation, loss of users, loss of marketers, loss of revenue, regulatory inquiries, litigation, or liability for fines, damages, or\\nother remedies, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be\\nadversely affected.\\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and\\nthird parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our\\nproprietary rights. In the United States and internationally, we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property, and\\nwe currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications\\nfrom third parties. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and\\npending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every\\ncountry in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all of these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order\\nto prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that\\nothers will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business. In addition, we regularly contribute software\\nsource code under open source and other permissive licenses and have made other technology we developed available under such licenses, and we include open\\nsource software in our products. Additionally, our AI is trained on data sets that may include open source software and the outputs of our AI may be subject to\\nopen source license restrictions or obligations. As a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products, we may license or be\\nrequired to license or disclose code and/or innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk. If the\\nprotection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brands and other intangible\\nassets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods of operations. Any of these events could\\nhave an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\\nWe are currently, and expect to be in the future, party to patent, trademark, and copyright lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are\\nexpensive and time consuming and, if resolved adversely, could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\\nCompanies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently\\nenter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various \"non-\\npracticing entities\" that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from\\ntechnology companies. Furthermore, from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products, including in areas where we historically have not competed,\\nor introduce new features for existing products, which could increase our exposure to intellectual property claims from competitors, non-practicing entities, and\\nother rights holders.\\nFrom time to time, we receive notice from patent, copyright, and trademark holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services,\\ntrademarks, or user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. We presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits, and as we face\\nincreasing competition and develop new products and services, we expect the number of intellectual property claims against us to grow. Defending intellectual\\nproperty litigation is often costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that favorable final\\noutcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any\\nsuch litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us\\n46'),\n",

Similarly, if any\\nlitigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. The terms of such\\na settlement or judgment may require us to change or cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we may\\nhave to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may\\nsignificantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices, or\\nbranding or discontinue the practices or branding.

Since shares of our Class A common stock were sold in\\nour initial public offering in May 2012 at a price of $38.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $17.55 to $638.40 through December 31, 2024. In\\naddition to the factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our Class A common stock has in the past fluctuated and may in the\\nfuture fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\\n• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results for either of our reportable segments;\\n• the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections, or our failure to meet these projections;\\n• actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our\\ncompany, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\\n• additional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us, our existing stockholders, or in connection with acquisitions, or the anticipation of\\nsuch sales;\\n• investor sentiment with respect to our competitors, our business partners, and our industry in general;\\n• announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint\\nventures, or capital commitments;\\n• announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base, the level of user engagement, or\\nthe effectiveness of our ad products;\\n• changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry, including our developers and\\ncompetitors;\\n• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\\n• the inclusion, exclusion, or deletion of our stock from any trading indices, such as the S&P 500 Index;\\n• media coverage of our business and financial performance;\\n• lawsuits threatened or filed against us, or developments in pending lawsuits;\\n• adverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising, competition, content, privacy, or other matters,\\nincluding interim or final rulings by tax, judicial, or regulatory bodies;\\n• trading activity in our share repurchase program; and\\n47\"),\n",

We are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the\\nmisuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies; the disclosure of our earnings results for the\\nsecond quarter of 2018; a former employee\\'s allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in September 2021; and the disclosure of our\\nearnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021. We may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility. Any securities litigation could\\nsubject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business.\\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders of our Class B\\ncommon stock; this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters.\\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Holders of our Class B common stock,\\nincluding our founder, Chairman, and CEO, together hold a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, and therefore are able to\\ncontrol the outcome of all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of Class B common stock represent at least 9.1% of all\\noutstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the\\nforeseeable future.\\nTransfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions,\\nsuch as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock will have the\\neffect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example,\\nMr. Zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control\\na majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock.\\nOur status as a \"controlled company\" could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, we are not required to have a majority\\nof our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. In the future we could\\nelect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function.\\nAccordingly, should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same\\nprotections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status as a\\ncontrolled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing\\nthe trading price of our Class A common stock.\\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a\\nchange in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes\\nan interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our current certificate of incorporation and\\nbylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\\n• until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 35% of the combined voting power of our\\ncommon stock, any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding\\nClass B common stock voting as a separate class;\\n• we currently have a dual class common stock structure, which provides Mr. Zuckerberg with the ability to control the outcome of matters\\nrequiring stockholder approval, even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common\\nstock;\\n48'),\n",

Our industry is prone to cybersecurity threats and\\nattacks, and we regularly experience cybersecurity incidents of varying degrees. We believe we are a particularly attractive target as a result of our prominence\\nand scale, the types and volume of personal data and content on our systems, and the evolving nature of our products and services. Our products and services\\nreach billions of users and involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of a large amount of data. In addition, our business and operations span\\nnumerous geographies around the world, involve thousands of employees, contractors, vendors, developers, partners, and other third parties, and rely on\\nsoftware and hardware that is highly technical and complex. We maintain an information security program that is comprised of policies and controls designed\\nto mitigate cybersecurity risk. However, at any given time, we face known and unknown cybersecurity risks and threats that are not fully mitigated, and we\\ndiscover vulnerabilities in our program. We continuously work to enhance our information security program and risk management efforts.\\nWe use a risk management framework based on applicable laws and regulations, and informed by industry standards and industry-recognized practices,\\nfor managing cybersecurity risks within our products and services, infrastructure, and corporate resources. To identify and assess risks from cybersecurity\\nthreats, we evaluate a variety of developments including threat intelligence, first- and third-party vulnerabilities, evolving regulatory requirements, and\\nobserved cybersecurity incidents, among others. We regularly conduct risk assessments to evaluate the maturity and effectiveness of our systems and processes\\nin addressing cybersecurity threats and to identify areas for remediation and opportunities for enhancements. We also engage third-party security experts and\\nconsultants to assist with assessment and enhancement of our cybersecurity risk management processes, as well as benchmarking against industry practices.\\nHowever, we may not be successful in fully addressing such areas for remediation or enhancement. In addition, we maintain a privacy risk management\\nprogram to assess privacy risks related to how we are collecting, using, sharing, and storing user data, which is subject to assessment by an independent, third-\\nparty privacy assessor. Our internal audit function provides independent assessment and assurance on the overall operations of our cybersecurity and privacy\\nprograms and the supporting control frameworks.

We also generally require third parties to, among other things,\\nmaintain security controls to protect our confidential information and data, and notify us of material data breaches that may impact our data.\\nOur board of directors has oversight of our strategic and business risk management and has delegated cybersecurity risk management oversight to the\\naudit & risk oversight committee of our board of directors (Audit & Risk Oversight Committee). Our Audit & Risk Oversight Committee is responsible for\\nensuring that management has processes in place designed to identify and evaluate cybersecurity risks to which the company is exposed and to implement\\nprocesses and programs to manage cybersecurity risks and mitigate cybersecurity incidents. The privacy & product compliance committee of our board of\\ndirectors (Privacy & Product Compliance Committee) oversees risks related to privacy and data use, including overseeing compliance with our comprehensive\\nprivacy program. Management is responsible for identifying, assessing, and managing material cybersecurity risks on an ongoing basis, establishing processes\\nto ensure that such potential cybersecurity risk exposures are monitored, putting in place appropriate mitigation measures, maintaining cybersecurity policies\\nand procedures, and providing regular reports to our board of directors, including through the Audit & Risk Oversight Committee and Privacy & Product\\nCompliance Committee.\\nOur Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Guy Rosen, leads our cybersecurity program and oversees teams across the company supporting our\\nsecurity functions of identify, prevent, detect, respond, and recover. These teams are comprised of personnel with a broad range of experience across the private\\nand public sectors, the technology industry, and different geographic regions. Mr. Rosen has two decades of experience in various cybersecurity, software\\ndevelopment, product management, and other technology-related roles. Mr. Rosen has served in a number of significant leadership roles at our company since\\n2013, including oversight of security, safety, and integrity initiatives, and was appointed as our CISO in 2022. Prior to joining our company, Mr. Rosen served\\nin senior leadership, engineering, and operational roles across technology organizations.\\nOur cybersecurity teams monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity incidents through a variety of technical and\\noperational measures, and regularly report to our CISO. Our CISO is part of the senior management team at the company and regularly updates the Audit &\\nRisk Oversight Committee on the company’s cybersecurity program, including cybersecurity risks, incidents, and mitigation strategies.\\nIn 2024, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy,\\nresults of operations, or financial condition. However, despite our efforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats, or provide assurances that\\nwe have not experienced undetected cybersecurity incidents. For additional information about these risks, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual\\nReport on Form 10-K.\\nItem 2.Properties\\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Menlo Park, California.

Although we believe many of these\\nmatters are without merit and are vigorously defending them, we may not be successful. Any litigation to which we are a party may be resolved adversely or\\nwe may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. We may also decide to settle litigation, disputes, or other legal\\nproceedings in some instances on terms that are unfavorable to us. In addition, we may become subject to orders or consent decrees imposed by government or\\nregulatory authorities. Any such developments could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to civil and criminal liability (including liability for our\\npersonnel) or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our\\nbusiness (including changes to our products and services or user data practices), result in negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the\\ntime and attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business. We have\\nexperienced such outcomes to varying degrees in the past, and we expect to continue to face a challenging litigation and regulatory environment, including in\\nlight of complex and evolving laws and regulations, as well as the scale of our business and the size of our user and advertiser base.\\nOver the last several years, the number and potential significance of the litigation and investigations involving the company have increased, and there\\ncan be no assurance that this trend will not continue. For example, we are facing numerous cases in the United States in which plaintiffs are attempting to avoid\\nor limit the application of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to their claims and certain of those matters have survived motions to dismiss,\\nincluding through the use of products liability theories. Outside of the United States, we are subject to new regulatory regimes, including the Digital Services\\nAct, Digital Markets Act, EU AI Act and similar statutes in non-EU countries such as the UK Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act, and new fining\\nguidelines under existing regulatory regimes like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We are facing inquiries and investigations regarding various\\naspects of our regulatory compliance, as well as private litigation in Europe, including class and mass actions, claiming damages (including for loss of control\\nof data without other damage) and/or injunctions in respect of alleged failings to comply with such regulatory requirements. We are also responding to\\nlitigation and government investigations related to our alleged role in causing or contributing to various societal harms, including mental and physical health\\nand safety impacts on users, particularly younger users, child and adult sexual exploitation, illegal activity with respect to drugs, fraud, unlawful\\ndiscrimination, and other harms potentially impacting large numbers of people. This is in addition to significant tax, competition and antitrust, stockholder,\\ncommercial, consumer, and privacy litigation and investigations.

With\\nrespect to the putative class actions alleging fraud and violations of consumer protection, privacy, and other laws in connection with the same matters, several\\nof the cases brought on behalf of consumers in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (In re\\nFacebook, Inc., Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation). On September 9, 2019, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the\\nconsolidated putative consumer class action. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement to resolve the lawsuit, which provides for\\na payment of $725 million by us. The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. Two objectors\\nappealed final approval (one of which was voluntarily dismissed as of June 24, 2024). The objection is fully briefed and will be heard on February 7, 2025. In\\naddition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal\\nTrade Commission (FTC), state\\n51'),\n",

We entered into a settlement and modified consent order\\nto resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020 and required us to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and\\nprocesses for privacy compliance and oversight. The state attorneys general inquiries and litigation and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions\\nremain ongoing and could subject us to additional substantial fines and costs, require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of\\nmanagement from our business, or adversely affect our business. On June 1, 2023, the court presiding over the lawsuit filed by the District of Columbia granted\\nour motion for summary judgment, resolving the case in our favor. On June 29, 2023, the District of Columbia filed a notice of appeal. The appeal is fully\\nbriefed and will be heard on January 30, 2025. Trial in the New Mexico Attorney General's case is scheduled to begin on December 1, 2025. On July 16, 2021,\\na stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and\\nrelated claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other stockholders filed an\\namended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current\\nand former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead plaintiffs filed a second\\namended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc. Derivative Litigation. On\\nJanuary 19, 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in part on May 10, 2023. The insider trading claim was dismissed as to all defendants except\\nMark Zuckerberg, and the motion was denied as to the breach of fiduciary duty claims. Trial is scheduled to begin on April 2, 2025.\\nOn May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding (In the Matter of Facebook, Inc.) seeking substantial changes to the modified consent\\norder, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a\\nproposed order and include, among others, a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the composition of our board of\\ndirectors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for\\nthe District of Columbia (USA v. Facebook, Inc.) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent order. On\\nNovember 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (U.S. v.\\nFacebook, Inc.) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding pending resolution of the appeal. Our motion for a stay pending appeal was denied in March 2024. The\\nunderlying appeal was then briefed and oral argument was held on November 5, 2024. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has yet to\\nrule.\\nOn November 29, 2023, we separately filed a complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC),\\nasserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the FTC, and seeking to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On\\nDecember 13, 2023, the FTC filed an opposition to our motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 14, 2024, the\\ndistrict court denied our motion to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation, and also denied the FTC's motion to dismiss\\nour complaint without prejudice, pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in SEC v. Jarkesy (Jarkesy). Our motion for a stay of the FTC proceeding pending\\nappeal was denied in March 2024. Both the district court action and the appeal were stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in Jarkesy. Following the\\nSupreme Court's ruling in Jarkesy on June 27, 2024, the government filed a renewed motion to dismiss, which was fully briefed as of October 18, 2024. The\\ndistrict court has yet to rule. The parties are required to report back to the circuit court within 30 days of the district court's disposition of the FTC's motion to\\ndismiss.\\nOn April 1, 2024, we filed our response to the FTC's Order to Show Cause, arguing, among other things, that the Order to Show Cause proceeding was\\nlegally improper. Per FTC orders, we completed briefing on threshold legal issues on July 18, 2024, and the FTC held oral argument before the Commissioners\\non those issues on November 12, 2024. On January 10, 2025, the Commission issued a decision on certain threshold legal issues, including that the\\nCommission has statutory authority to modify consent orders. The Commission stated that its decision is subject to Meta’s jurisdictional challenges currently\\npending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in U.S. v. Facebook, Inc., and that the nature and scope of any further\\nadministrative proceedings would be addressed at a later date. Through the administrative process, the FTC could amend the order to impose the additional\\nrequirements set forth in the proposed order. We should have the opportunity to appeal an FTC decision modifying the order and could request the appellate\\ncourt to stay the enforcement of the modifications to the order while the appeal is pending. It is unclear whether the appeal or the request for a stay would be\\nsuccessful.\\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the GDPR, of certain other personal data\\nbreaches and privacy issues, issue similar notifications to European regulators under\\n52\"),\n",

For example, the IDPC is continuing to assess the compliance of our\\n\"subscription for no ads\" consent model with requirements under the GDPR. In addition, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that\\nMeta Platforms Ireland\\'s reliance on Standard Contractual Clauses in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was\\nnot in compliance with the GDPR. The IDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders requiring Meta Platforms Ireland to\\nsuspend the relevant transfers and to bring its processing operations into compliance with Chapter V GDPR by ceasing the unlawful processing, including\\nstorage, of such data in the United States. We are appealing this Final Decision and it is currently subject to an interim stay from the Irish High Court. On\\nOctober 7, 2022, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities (E.O.), and on June 30,\\n2023, the European Union and the three additional countries making up the EEA were designated by the United States Attorney General as a \"qualifying state\"\\nunder Section 3(f) of the E.O. On July 10, 2023, the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision in relation to the United States. The adequacy\\ndecision concludes that the United States ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data transferred from the European Union to organizations in the\\nUnited States that are included in the \"Data Privacy Framework List,\" maintained and made publicly available by the United States Department of Commerce\\npursuant to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF). The implementation of the EU-U.S. DPF and the adequacy decision are important and\\nwelcome milestones, and we have implemented steps to comply with the above corrective orders following engagement with the IDPC. For additional\\ninformation, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data\\nuse, data combination, data protection, content, competition, youth, safety, consumer protection, advertising, e-commerce, and other matters\" in this Annual\\nReport on Form 10‑K. Any such inquiries or investigations (including the IDPC proceedings) could subject us to substantial fines and costs, require us to\\nchange our business practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or adversely affect our business.\\nBeginning on June 7, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we improperly received individuals\\' information from\\nthird-party websites or apps via our business tools in violation of our terms and various state and federal laws and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive\\nrelief (for example, In re Meta Pixel Healthcare Litigation; In re Meta Pixel Tax Filing Cases; Frasco v. Flo Health, Inc.; Doe v. Hey Favor, Inc. et al.; Doe v.\\nGoodRx Holdings, Inc. et al. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California; and Rickwalder, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. in the Santa Clara\\nCounty Superior Court). These cases are in different stages, but several of our motions to dismiss have been denied in whole or in part, while certain others\\nhave been granted in whole or in part. We are currently in discovery and litigating class certification in the cases that are most advanced.\\nCompetition\\nWe are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States,\\nEurope, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social\\nnetworking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in 2019 we became the\\nsubject of antitrust investigations by the FTC and U.S. Department of Justice. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint (FTC v. Meta Platforms, Inc.)\\nagainst us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in\\nviolation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in\\n2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The FTC sought a permanent injunction against our company\\'s alleged violations of the antitrust\\nlaws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motion to dismiss\\nthe complaint filed by the FTC with leave to amend. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to\\ndismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC\\'s amended complaint. On April 5, 2024, we filed our\\nmotion for summary judgment and the FTC filed its opposition and its own motion for partial summary judgment on May 24, 2024. On November 13, 2024,\\nthe court granted in part and denied in part both our and the FTC’s motions for summary judgment. Trial is set to begin on April 14, 2025. Multiple putative\\nclass actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the United States and in the United Kingdom against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and\\nother causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and/or other alleged anticompetitive conduct, and seeking damages and injunctive relief. Several of\\nthe cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users in the United States were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of\\nCalifornia (Klein et al., v. Meta Platforms, Inc.). On January 14, 2022, the court granted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated\\nactions.

On December 30, 2024,\\nwe filed our motion for summary judgment in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers.\\nIn December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a\\nmanner that infringes European Union competition rules. On November 18, 2024, the European Commission issued a decision that Meta infringed Article 102\\non the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union in relation to certain alleged business practices relating to Facebook Marketplace and imposed a fine of\\napproximately EUR €798 million. We appealed the European Commission\\'s decision on January 28, 2025.\\nIn March 2024, the European Commission opened an investigation into the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" consent model with\\nrequirements under Article 5(2) of the Digital Markets Act. The European Commission issued preliminary findings on July 1, 2024 reflecting its preliminary\\nview that our model does not comply with such requirements, and indicated that it will conclude its investigation by March 2025.\\nThe result of such litigation, investigations or inquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our\\nbusiness practices, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely\\naffect our business.\\nSecurities and Other Actions\\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and\\nelsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in\\nconnection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of\\nour terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court\\nin the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District\\nCourt for the Northern District of California (In Re Facebook, Inc. Securities Litigation) with the putative securities class action described above relating to our\\nplatform and user data practices. In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the plaintiffs\\' claims. On January 17,\\n2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case, and on October 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued\\nits decision affirming in part and reversing in part the district court\\'s order dismissing the plaintiffs\\' case. We filed a petition for writ of certiorari on March 4,\\n2024 with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the Ninth Circuit\\'s order. The Supreme Court granted in part our petition for writ of certiorari on June 10,\\n2024, and following oral argument issued an order on November 22, 2024 dismissing the grant of certiorari as improvidently granted.\\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning\\nin September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to a former employee\\'s allegations and release of internal company\\ndocuments concerning, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and\\nother undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received additional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on\\nOctober 27, 2021, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us\\nand certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with the same\\nmatters, and seeking unspecified damages (Ohio Pub. Empl. Ret. Sys. v. Meta Platforms, Inc.). On September 30, 2024, the court dismissed certain claims with\\nleave to amend, but determined certain claims regarding content enforcement practices and user well-being could proceed against us and certain of our current\\nand former directors and officers.\\nOn March 8, 2022, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain of our\\ndirectors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and seeking\\nunspecified damages (Plumbers & Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Trust v. Meta Platforms, Inc.). On July 18, 2023, the court dismissed the claims against Meta\\nand its officers with leave to amend. On September 18, 2023, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and on September 17, 2024, the court dismissed the\\nclaims with prejudice.

Putative class actions have been filed in the United States, Brazil, and Canada on behalf of users in those jurisdictions, and numerous school\\ndistricts, municipalities, and tribal nations have filed public nuisance claims in the United States, Brazil, and/or Canada based on similar allegations. On\\nOctober 6, 2022, the U.S. federal cases were centralized in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (In re Social Media Adolescent\\nAddiction Product Liability Personal Injury Litigation). Beginning in March 2023, U.S. states and territories began filing lawsuits on these topics in various\\nfederal and state courts. These additional lawsuits include allegations regarding violations of the Children\\'s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), child\\nsexual abuse material and other child safety concerns, as well as violations of state consumer protection laws, unfair business practices, public nuisance, and\\nproducts liability, with proceedings focused on our alleged business practices (including the use of end-to-end encryption) and harms to users under 18 years\\nold. These lawsuits seek damages and injunctive relief, and include cases filed by various state attorneys general in In re Social Media Adolescent Addiction\\nProduct Liability Personal Injury Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, as well as various state courts around the country.\\nBeginning in November 2024, counsel for thousands of individual claimants began sending mass arbitration demands relating to \"social media addiction\" and\\nrelated harms allegedly caused by Instagram.\\nWe are also subject to government investigations and requests from multiple regulators in various jurisdictions globally concerning the use of our\\nproducts and services, and the alleged mental and physical health and safety impacts on users, particularly younger users. On May 16, 2024, the European\\nCommission opened formal proceedings assessing our compliance with certain requirements under Articles 28, 34, and 35 of the Digital Services Act (DSA),\\nincluding the way in which we identified, assessed, and mitigated against certain systemic risks to minors and other vulnerable users that may stem from the\\ndesign and functioning of Instagram and Facebook.\\nOther Actions\\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size\\nfor advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District\\nof California (DZ Reserve v. Facebook, Inc.) and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022, the court\\ndismissed certain of the plaintiffs\\' claims, but permitted their fraud and unfair competition claims to proceed. On March 29, 2022, the court granted the\\nplaintiffs\\' motion for class certification. On March 21, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the order\\ngranting class certification. On May 3, 2024, we filed a petition for panel rehearing and rehearing en banc, which was denied by the Ninth Circuit.

Revenue on a constant\\ncurrency basis is presented in the section entitled \"—Revenue—Foreign Exchange Impact on Revenue.\" To calculate revenue on a constant currency basis, we\\ntranslated revenue for the full year 2024 using 2023 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar. For a full\\ndescription of our free cash flow non-GAAP measure, see the section entitled \"—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Free Cash Flow.\"\\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and\\npresented in accordance with GAAP. These measures may be different from non‑GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness\\nfor comparison purposes. Moreover, presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for year-over-year comparison purposes, and investors\\nshould be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results. We believe these non-GAAP\\nfinancial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial\\nresults between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics\\nused by management in operating our business.\\nExecutive Overview of Full Year 2024 Results\\nOur mission is to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.\\nOur financial results and key Family metrics for 2024 are set forth below. Total revenue for 2024 was $164.50 billion, an increase of 22% compared to\\n2023, due to an increase in advertising revenue. Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 23% compared to 2023. Ad impressions delivered\\nacross our Family of Apps in 2024 increased 11% year-over-year, and our average price per ad increased 10% year-over-year.\\nIncome from operations for 2024 was $69.38 billion, an increase of $22.63 billion, or 48%, compared to 2023, driven by an increase in advertising\\nrevenue, partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses. The increase in costs and expenses was mainly due to increases in operational expenses related to\\nour data centers and technical infrastructure and employee compensation, partially offset by lower restructuring and legal-related costs.\\n59'),\n",

We rely on targeting and measurement tools that\\nincorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control, as well as signals generated within our products, in order to deliver\\nrelevant and effective ads to our users. Our advertising revenue has been, and we expect will continue to be, adversely affected by reduced marketer spending\\nas a result of limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and third-party mobile operating\\nsystems and browsers.\\nIn particular, legislative and regulatory developments such as the General Data Protection Regulation, including its evolving interpretation through\\ndecisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union, ePrivacy Directive, European Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, and U.S. state privacy laws\\nincluding the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, have impacted our ability to use data signals in our ad\\nproducts, and an increasing\\n60'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'F:\\\\Multi-User Document Search and Conversational Q&A System\\\\data\\\\Meta\\\\Meta.pdf'}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nnumber of laws have been introduced limiting or prohibiting the provision of our services to younger users. We expect these and other developments will have\\nfurther impact in the future. As a result, we have implemented, and we will continue to implement, whether voluntarily or otherwise, changes to our products\\nand user data practices, which reduce our ability to effectively target and measure ads and may negatively impact our advertising revenue and user engagement.\\nFor example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced our plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and\\nInstagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and began offering users in the region a\\n\"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We subsequently began offering users in the region who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by\\nads, an option to see less personalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings. We are engaging with regulators\\non our consent model. In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have implemented product changes and/or\\nannounced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For\\nexample, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and\\nother iOS developers\\' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of\\nthe budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms.\\nTo mitigate these developments, we are continually working to evolve our advertising systems to improve the performance of our ad products. We are\\ndeveloping privacy enhancing technologies to deliver relevant ads and measurement capabilities while reducing the amount of personal information we\\nprocess, including by relying more on anonymized or aggregated third-party data. In addition, we are developing tools that enable marketers to share their data\\ninto our systems, as well as ad products that generate more valuable signals within our apps. More broadly, we also continue to innovate our advertising tools\\nto help marketers prepare campaigns and connect with consumers, including developing growing formats such as Reels ads and our business messaging ad\\nproducts. Across all of these efforts, we are making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI, to improve our delivery,\\ntargeting, and measurement capabilities. Further, we are focused on driving onsite conversions in our business messaging ad products by developing new\\nfeatures and scaling existing features.\\nWe are also engaging with others across our industry to explore the possibility of new open standards for the private and secure processing of data for\\nadvertising purposes. We believe our ongoing improvements to ad targeting and measurement are continuing to drive improved results for advertisers.\\nHowever, we expect that some of these efforts will be long-term initiatives, and that the legislative, regulatory and platform developments described above will\\ncontinue to adversely impact our advertising revenue for the foreseeable future.\\nIn addition, we maintain advertising policies to protect the security and integrity of our platform and comply with global content, security, and integrity\\nobligations. Our ongoing efforts to enhance enforcement against ads and marketers which violate our advertising policies adversely affect our revenue, and we\\nexpect that the continued enhancement of such efforts will have an impact on our revenue in the future, which may be material.\\nOther Business and Macroeconomic Conditions\\nOther global and regional business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical conditions also have had, and we believe will continue to have, an impact on our\\nuser growth and engagement and advertising revenue. In particular, we believe advertising budgets have been pressured from time to time by factors such as\\ninflation, high interest rates, and related market uncertainty, which has led to reduced marketer spending. While we saw improvement in business and\\nmacroeconomic conditions in recent periods, continued business, macroeconomic, and geopolitical uncertainty remains, which could impact our financial\\nresults in future periods.\\nIn addition, competitive products and services have reduced some users\\' engagement with our products and services. We are investing in Reels and in AI\\ninitiatives across our products, including our AI-powered discovery engine to recommend relevant content, which we have already seen results in improved\\nuser engagement and monetization of our products. However, we continue to face competition from other products and services within certain demographics,\\nin particular younger users. In addition, while Reels is growing in usage, it monetizes at a lower rate than our Feed and Stories products and we expect it will\\ncontinue to monetize at a lower rate for the foreseeable future. We also have seen fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more\\nregions from time to time due to geopolitical conditions, which have adversely affected our user growth and engagement. These trends adversely affected\\nadvertising revenue in 2024, and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue in the foreseeable future.\\n61'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'F:\\\\Multi-User Document Search and Conversational Q&A System\\\\data\\\\Meta\\\\Meta.pdf'}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nAlthough we regularly evaluate a variety of sources to understand trends in our advertising revenue, we do not have perfect visibility into the factors\\ndriving advertiser spending decisions and our assessments involve complex judgments about what is driving advertising decisions across a large and diversified\\nadvertiser base across the globe. Trends impacting advertising spend are also dynamic and interrelated. As a result, it is difficult to identify with precision\\nwhich advertiser spending decisions are attributable to which trends, and we are unable to quantify the exact impact that each trend had on our advertising\\nrevenue during the periods presented.\\nInvestment Philosophy\\nWe expect to continue to build on the discipline and habits that we developed in 2022 when we initiated several efforts to increase our operating\\nefficiency, while still remaining focused on investing in significant opportunities. In 2024, 79% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and\\n21% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments include expenses relating to headcount, data centers, and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to\\ndevelop our apps and our advertising services. These efforts include significant investments in AI initiatives, including to recommend relevant content across\\nour products, enhance our advertising tools, develop new products, and develop new features for existing products using generative AI. In particular, we expect\\nour AI initiatives will require increased investment in infrastructure and headcount.\\nWe are also making significant investments in our metaverse and wearables efforts, including developing virtual, augmented, and mixed reality devices,\\nsoftware for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies. Our RL investments include expenses relating to technology development\\nacross these efforts. Many of our RL investments are directed toward long-term, cutting-edge research and development for products that may only be fully\\nrealized in the next decade. In 2024, our RL segment reduced our overall operating profit by approximately $17.73 billion, and we continue to expect our RL\\noperating losses to increase in 2025. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative, and our ability to support our RL efforts is dependent\\non generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will\\nunlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.\\n62'),\n",

Substantially all of our daily active people (as defined below) access our\\nFamily products on mobile devices.\\n•Daily Active People (DAP). We define a daily active person as a registered and logged-in user of Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and/or WhatsApp\\n(collectively, our \"Family\" of products) who visited at least one of these Family products through a mobile device application or using a web or\\nmobile browser on a given day. We do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our Family, and\\ntherefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people. Our calculations of DAP rely upon complex\\ntechniques, algorithms, and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these\\nproducts, including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a\\nsingle person, and counting such group of accounts as one person. As these techniques and models require significant judgment, are developed based\\non internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts, and are calibrated against user survey data, there is necessarily some margin of error in our\\nestimates.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to\\nmake estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing\\nbasis, we evaluate our accounting estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the\\ncircumstances. The actual impact on our financial performance could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\\nAn accounting estimate is considered critical if both (i) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and\\njudgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimates and assumptions is material to our consolidated financial\\nstatements. We believe that the estimates and assumptions associated with loss contingencies, income taxes, and valuation of assets, when applicable, have the\\ngreatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. For further information\\non all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial\\nstatements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nLoss Contingencies\\nWe are involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business.\\nCertain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. Additionally, we are required to comply with various\\nlegal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The\\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any\\nfailure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we\\nevaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the\\namount can be reasonably estimated.\\nWe review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and\\nrelated reasonably possible losses disclosed. We make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our\\ndefenses and the impact of negotiations, settlements, regulatory proceedings, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is\\nrequired to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss, including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and\\nunasserted matters. Certain factors, in particular, have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updated\\ninformation available. For example, in certain jurisdictions where we operate, fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretations\\nregarding the basis of assessing damages, which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted\\nagainst us. In addition, certain government inquiries and investigations, such as matters before our lead European Union privacy regulator, the Irish Data\\nProtection Commission, are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized, which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of\\nan inquiry. As a result of these and other factors, we reasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be\\nrevised in the future.\\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable or if and when the reasonably\\npossible range of loss is estimable, is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts that materially differ\\nfrom management\\'s estimates of losses, it could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our results of operations and financial condition, including in a\\nparticular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable. See Note 12 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15 —\\nIncome Taxes of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\"\\nand Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these contingencies.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.

These uncertain tax positions include our estimates related to uncertainties\\nwith our research and development tax credits that are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities\\nsupporting the tax credits will be sufficient. Similarly, our estimates for transfer pricing have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate arms-length\\nprices. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), we can provide no assurance\\nthat the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different, as significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision for\\nincome taxes. We make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such as the\\nclosing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such\\ndifferences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made, and could have a material impact on our financial\\ncondition and operating results.\\nValuation of Assets\\nThe valuation and impairment assessment of certain assets, including recoverability, requires significant judgment and assumptions such as estimation of\\nfuture cash flows, discount rates, market data of comparable assets and companies, holding period and residual value of asset groups, among others.\\nImpairment testing for long-lived-assets, including property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets, occurs whenever events or\\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable compared to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected\\nto generate from the use and eventual disposition. The impairment test is performed at the asset group level for which identifiable cash flows are largely\\nindependent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When the test results indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets is not recoverable, the\\ncarrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.\\nImpairment testing for non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative is\\nperformed at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. Such qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not\\nlimited to, the investee's financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; regulatory, economic or technological environment;\\noperational and financing cash flows; and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee. When indicators of impairment exist, we estimate the fair\\nvalue of our non-marketable equity securities using the market approach and/or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in our consolidated\\nstatements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value. In addition, for these non-marketable equity securities, determining whether a\\nnon-marketable equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the non-marketable equity security we hold may require judgment in (a) assessment of\\ndifferences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights, distribution rights and preferences, and conversion features, and (b)\\nadjustments to the observable price for differences such as, but not limited to, rights and obligations, control premium, liquidity, or principal or most\\nadvantageous markets. The identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies,\\nwhich may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place. Therefore, our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur\\nin a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred.\\nChange in Accounting Estimate\\nIn January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, which resulted in an increase in their estimated\\nuseful life to 5.5 years, effective beginning fiscal year 2025. Based on the servers and network assets placed in service as of December 31, 2024, we expect this\\nchange in accounting estimate will reduce our full-year 2025 depreciation expense by approximately $2.9 billion. For information regarding the change in\\nuseful lives of our servers and network assets, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n69\"),\n",

The increase was almost entirely driven by advertising revenue.\\nAdvertising\\nAdvertising revenue in 2024 increased $28.68 billion, or 22%, compared to 2023 due to increases in ad impressions delivered and average price per ad.\\nIn 2024, ad impressions delivered increased by 11%, as compared with a 28% increase in 2023, year-over-year. Ad impressions delivered during 2024 grew in\\nall regions, especially in Asia-Pacific and Rest of World, which was mostly driven by increases in users and their engagement on our products. In 2024, the\\naverage price per ad increased by 10%, as compared with a decrease of 9% in 2023, year-over-year. The increase in average price per ad in 2024 was driven by\\nan increase in advertising demand, which we believe is mainly due to ongoing improvements to our ad performance from our ad targeting and measurement\\ntools. This increase was partially offset by a higher number of ad impressions delivered, especially in geographies and in products, such as Reels, that monetize\\nat lower rates. Other factors are discussed in the section entitled \"—Executive Overview of Full Year 2024 Results.\" In addition, the online commerce vertical\\nwas the largest contributor to the increase in advertising revenue in 2024 compared to 2023. We anticipate that future advertising revenue will be driven by a\\ncombination of price and ad impressions delivered.\\nOther revenue\\nFoA other revenue in 2024 increased $664 million, or 63%, compared to 2023.

The increase was mostly due to an increase in RL consumer hardware products\\nsold.\\nRevenue Seasonality\\nRevenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. We believe that this seasonality in\\nboth advertising revenue and RL consumer hardware sales affects our quarterly results, which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third\\nand fourth quarters and a decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters. For instance, our total revenue increased 19%, 17%, and 16% between the\\nthird and fourth quarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, while total revenue for the first quarters of 2024, 2023, and 2022 declined 9%, 11%, and 17%\\ncompared to the fourth quarters of 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\\n72'),\n",

This includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses incurred in 2024, as\\nrequired by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory capitalization requirement increased our 2024 cash tax liabilities materially but also\\ndecreased our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization is deferred, our effective tax\\nrate in 2025 could be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be lower.\\nA number of countries have enacted legislation to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s 15% global minimum tax\\nregime with effect from January 1, 2024. These changes did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for 2024. We continue to\\nevaluate the impacts of proposed and enacted legislation with respect to the global minimum tax regime in the jurisdictions we operate in. As additional\\njurisdictions enact legislation, transitional relief expires, and other provisions of the minimum tax legislation become effective, our effective tax rate and cash\\ntax payments could increase in future years.\\n75'),\n",

Any realized\\ngains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes and from the current unrealized gains or losses would only occur if we sold the investments prior to\\nmaturity.\\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we also had aggregate principal amounts of fixed-rate senior notes (the Notes) outstanding of $29.0 billion and\\n$18.50 billion, respectively. Since our Notes bear interest at fixed rates and are carried at amortized cost, fluctuations in interest rates do not have any impact\\non our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of the Notes will fluctuate with movements in market interest rates, increasing in periods of\\ndeclining interest rates and declining in periods of increasing interest rates.\\nEquity Price Risk\\nOur equity investments include marketable and non-marketable equity securities subject to equity price risks that could have a material impact on the\\nfair value or carrying value of our holdings. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks and our non-marketable equity securities are\\ninvestments in privately-held companies without readily determinable fair values.\\n79'),\n",

A hypothetical adverse\\nprice change of 10% on our December 31, 2024 balance would decrease the fair value of marketable equity securities by $123 million. We did not hold any\\nmarketable equity securities as of December 31, 2023.\\nWe elected to account for substantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment,\\nadjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar securities of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative\\nassessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. The qualitative assessment considers factors such as, but not\\nlimited to, the investee\\'s financial condition and business outlook; industry and sector performance; economic or technological environment; and other relevant\\nevents and factors affecting the investee. Valuations of our non-marketable equity securities are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and\\nobservable transactions. Uncertainties in the global economic climate and financial markets could adversely impact the valuation of the companies we invest in\\nand, therefore, result in a material impairment or downward adjustment in our investments. Our total non-marketable equity securities, which mostly consists\\nof our investment in Jio Platforms Limited, had a carrying value of $6.07 billion and $6.14 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\\nFor additional information, see Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 5 — Financial Instruments, Note 6 — Non-marketable\\nEquity Securities, and Note 10 — Long-term Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and\\nSupplementary Data\" and Part II, Item 7, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting\\nEstimates\" contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n80'),\n",

A company's internal control over\\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nJanuary 29, 2025\\n85\"),\n",

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nOrganization and Description of Business\\nWe were incorporated in Delaware in July 2004. Our mission is to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.\\nWe report our financial results based on two reportable segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). The segment information aligns with\\nhow the chief operating decision maker (CODM), who is our chief executive officer (CEO), reviews and manages the business. We generate substantially all of\\nour revenue from advertising.\\nBasis of Presentation\\nWe prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The consolidated financial\\nstatements include the accounts of Meta Platforms, Inc., its subsidiaries where we have controlling financial interests, and any variable interest entities for\\nwhich we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nBalance Sheets Reclassifications\\nCertain prior period amounts on the consolidated balance sheets have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\\n•Intangible assets, net was reclassified into other assets\\n•Partners payable was reclassified into accrued expenses and other current liabilities\\n•Long-term income taxes was reclassified out of other liabilities\\nThese reclassifications had no impact on our previously reported total assets, total liabilities, revenue, income from operations, net income or cash flows.\\nUse of Estimates\\nPreparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts\\nin the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates form the basis for judgments we make about the carrying values of our assets\\nand liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. We base our estimates and judgments on historical information and on various other\\nassumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments in several areas, including, but not\\nlimited to, those related to loss contingencies, income taxes, valuation of long-lived assets and their associated estimated useful lives, valuation of non-\\nmarketable equity securities, revenue recognition, valuation of goodwill, credit losses of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities and accounts receivable, and\\nfair value of financial instruments and leases. These estimates are based on management's knowledge about current events, interpretation of regulations, and\\nexpectations about actions we may undertake in the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\\nIn January 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of certain servers and network assets, and determined we should extend the estimated\\nuseful lives to 5.5 years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2025.\\n92\"),\n",

Revenue is recognized when\\ncontrol of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for\\nthose goods or services.\\nSales commissions we pay in connection with contracts are expensed when incurred because the amortization period is one year or less. These costs are\\nrecorded within marketing and sales on our consolidated statements of income. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for\\ncontracts with an original expected length of one year or less.\\nRevenue includes sales and usage‑based taxes, except for cases where we are acting as a pass‑through agent.\\nAdvertising Revenue\\nAdvertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party mobile applications. Marketers pay for\\nad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of\\nactions, such as clicks, taken by our users.\\nWe recognize revenue from the display of impression-based ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are\\nconsidered delivered when an ad is displayed to users. We recognize revenue from the delivery of action-based ads in the period in which a user takes the\\naction the marketer contracted for. In general, we report advertising revenue on a gross basis, since we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred\\nto our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers.\\nFor revenue generated from arrangements that involve third-parties, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenue on a gross basis, or the\\nagent, and report revenue on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the\\ncustomer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\\nWe may accept lower consideration than the amount promised per the contract for certain revenue transactions and certain customers may receive cash-\\nbased incentives, credits, or refunds, which are accounted for as variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize. We estimate these\\namounts and reduce revenue based on the amounts expected to be provided to customers. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates\\nof variable consideration for the reported periods.\\nReality Labs Revenue\\nRL revenue is generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products, such as Meta Quest and Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, and related software and\\ncontent. Revenue is recognized at the time control of the products is transferred to customers, which is generally at the time of delivery, in an amount that\\nreflects the consideration RL expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products.\\nOther Revenue\\nFoA other revenue consists of revenue from WhatsApp Business Platform, Meta Verified subscriptions, net fees we receive from developers using our\\nPayments infrastructure, and revenue from various other sources.\\nCost of Revenue\\nOur cost of revenue consists of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products. These mainly include expenses related to the\\noperation of our data centers and technical infrastructure, such as depreciation expense from servers, network infrastructure and buildings, employee\\ncompensation which includes payroll, share-based compensation and benefits for employees on our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of\\nrevenue also consists of costs associated with partner arrangements, including traffic acquisition costs and credit card and other fees related to processing\\ncustomer transactions; RL inventory costs, which consist of cost of products sold and estimated losses on non-cancelable contractual commitments; and content\\ncosts.\\n93'),\n",

Video content costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material to\\ndate.\\nFor licensed music, we expense the license fees over the contractual license period. We pay fees to music partners based on revenue generated, minimum\\nguaranteed fees, flat fees, or a combination thereof. Expensed content costs are included in cost of revenue on our consolidated statements of income.\\nSoftware Development Costs\\nSoftware development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed or sold to external\\nusers, are expensed before the software or technology reach technological feasibility, which is typically reached shortly before the release of such products.\\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and applications used to deliver our services.\\nThese software development costs meet the criteria for capitalization once the preliminary project stage is complete, and it is probable that the project will be\\ncompleted and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Software development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material\\nto date.\\nShare-based Compensation\\nShare-based compensation expense consists of the company's restricted stock units (RSUs) expense. RSUs granted to employees are measured based on\\nthe grant-date fair value. In general, our RSUs vest over a service period of four years. Share-based compensation expense is generally recognized on the\\nstraight-line basis over the requisite service period and forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for\\nincome taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.\\nUnder this method, we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial\\nreporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax\\nrates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We recognize the\\ndeferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment.\\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider\\nall available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable\\nincome and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on\\nexamination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a\\ncomponent of the provision for income taxes.\\nAdvertising Expense\\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in marketing and sales expenses on our consolidated statements of income.

Our AFS investments are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes,\\nincluded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders' equity. AFS debt securities with an amortized cost basis in excess of estimated fair\\nvalue are assessed to determine what amount of that difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses.

We elected to account for\\nsubstantially all of our non-marketable equity securities using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair\\nvalue resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer as of the respective transaction dates. We periodically\\nreview our non-marketable equity securities for impairment.

We define fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are\\nrequired to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk\\nmeasurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer\\nrestrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels\\nand bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\\nLevel 1- Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\n95\"),\n",

Certain other assets are\\nclassified within Level 3 because factors used to develop the estimated fair value are unobservable inputs that are not supported by market activity.\\nOur non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. When\\nindicators of impairment exist or observable price changes of qualified transactions occur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified\\nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and\\nother unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold.\\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances\\nAccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. We make\\nestimates of expected credit and collectibility trends for the allowance for credit losses and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of\\nvarious factors, including historical experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality of our customers, current economic conditions,\\nreasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability to collect from customers. Expected credit\\nlosses are recorded as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for\\ncredit losses on accounts receivable were not material.\\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment, including finance leases, are depreciated and stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the\\nstraight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the remaining lease term, whichever is shorter.\\nThe estimated useful lives of property and equipment and amortization periods of finance lease right-of-use (ROU) assets as of December 31, 2024 are\\ndescribed below:\\nProperty and Equipment Useful Life/ Amortization period\\nServers and network assets Four to Five years \\nBuildings 25 to 30 years\\nEquipment and other One to 25 years\\nFinance lease right-of-use assets Five to 20 years\\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term\\n_______________________\\n(1) Effective January 2025, the useful lives of certain servers and network assets are extended to 5.5 years.\\nWe evaluate at least annually the recoverability of property and equipment for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the\\ncarrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.

We also capitalize interest on our debt related to certain eligible CIP assets and depreciate over the useful life of the\\nrelated assets.\\nThe cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated\\ndepreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operations.\\nLease Obligations\\nOur operating leases mostly comprise of certain data centers, offices, and colocations. We also have finance leases for certain network infrastructure. We\\ndetermine if an arrangement is a lease at inception and most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components include fixed\\npayments for maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes, and management fees. We combine fixed lease and non-lease components and account for them as a\\nsingle lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations, common area maintenance, insurance, real estate\\ntaxes, or other costs. These amounts are affected by the Consumer Price Index, payments contingent on energy production for renewable energy purchase\\narrangements, and maintenance and utilities. Such variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on our consolidated statements of income. For certain\\ncolocation and equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities.\\nFor leases with a lease term greater than 12 months, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on our consolidated balance sheets at the\\ncommencement date based on the present value of the remaining fixed lease payments and includes only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time\\nof commencement.\\nOur lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When determining\\nthe probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based, asset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors. We do not assume renewals in our\\ndetermination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured. Our lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual\\nvalue guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\\nAs most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement\\ndate in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be in a\\nsimilar economic environment.\\nOperating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current, and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our\\nconsolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on\\nour consolidated balance sheets.\\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

The fair values of the impaired assets were estimated using discounted cash flow models (income approach) based on market participant\\nassumptions with Level 3 inputs. The assumptions used in estimating fair value include the expected downtime prior to the commencement of future subleases,\\nprojected sublease income over the remaining lease periods, and discount rates that reflect the level of risk associated with receiving future cash flows.

Additionally, we are required to comply with various\\nlegal and regulatory obligations around the world, and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The\\nrequirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities, and any\\nfailure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action. With respect to these matters, asserted and unasserted, we\\nevaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the\\namount can be reasonably estimated. We record such losses as general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income.\\nIf we determine that a loss is probable or reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the possible loss in\\nthe accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material.\\nBusiness Combinations\\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their\\nestimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and\\nliabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. Allocation of purchase consideration to\\nidentifiable assets and liabilities affects the amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any\\nindefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition\\ndate, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement\\nperiod, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from business combinations and are\\nexpensed as incurred.\\nGoodwill and Intangibles Assets\\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from business combinations. We evaluate our reporting units annually, as well as\\nwhen changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is\\ntested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair\\nvalue of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We have two reporting units, Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL), subject to goodwill impairment\\ntesting. As of December 31, 2024, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\\nWe evaluate the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying\\namount of such assets may not be recoverable. The evaluation of these intangible assets are performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are\\nlargely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the\\nfuture undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of a\\nfinite-lived intangible asset is not recoverable and the asset's fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment charge is recognized. The impairment\\ncharges of finite-lived intangible assets were not material during the reporting periods presented.\\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are\\nnot amortized. If an indefinite-lived intangible asset is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life, the asset will be tested for impairment and\\naccounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives\\nof finite-lived intangible assets. If we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over the\\nrevised estimated useful life.

Cash equivalents consists mostly of money market funds, that primarily invest in U.S. government and\\nagency securities. Marketable debt securities consist of investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade\\ncorporate debt securities. As part of our cash management strategy, we concentrate cash deposits with large financial institutions and our marketable debt\\nsecurities are held in diversified highly rated securities.

The settlement was approved by the court on October 10, 2023, and the payment was made in November 2023. Two objectors\\nappealed final approval (one of which was voluntarily dismissed as of June 24, 2024). The objection is fully briefed and will be heard on February 7, 2025. In\\naddition, our platform and user data practices, as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer, became the subject of U.S. Federal\\nTrade Commission (FTC), state attorneys general, and other government inquiries in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. We entered into a\\nsettlement and modified consent order to resolve the FTC inquiry, which took effect in April 2020. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC required\\nus to pay a penalty of $5.0 billion which was paid in April 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified consent order. The state attorneys general inquiries and\\nlitigation and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing. On June 1, 2023, the court presiding over the lawsuit filed by the District of\\nColumbia granted our motion for summary judgment, resolving the case in our favor. On June 29, 2023, the District of Columbia filed a notice of appeal. The\\nappeal is fully briefed and will be heard on January 30, 2025. Trial in the New Mexico Attorney General's case is scheduled to begin on December 1, 2025. On\\nJuly 16, 2021, a stockholder derivative action was filed in Delaware Court of Chancery against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of\\nfiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices, as well as our settlement with the FTC. On July 20, 2021, other\\nstockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related Delaware Chancery Court action, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against\\ncertain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices. On November 4, 2021, the lead\\nplaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action. The pending consolidated matter is In re Facebook Inc.\\nDerivative Litigation. On January 19, 2022, we filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in part on May 10, 2023. The insider trading claim was dismissed\\nas to all defendants except Mark Zuckerberg, and the motion was denied as to the breach of fiduciary duty claims. Trial is scheduled to begin on April 2, 2025.\\nOn May 3, 2023, the FTC filed a public administrative proceeding (In the Matter of Facebook, Inc.) seeking substantial changes to the modified consent\\norder, which took effect in April 2020 after its entry by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The changes sought by the FTC are set forth in a\\nproposed order and include, among others, a prohibition on our use of minors' data for any commercial purposes, changes to the composition of our board of\\ndirectors, and significant limitations on our ability to modify and launch new products. On May 31, 2023, we filed a motion before the U.S. District Court for\\nthe District of Columbia (USA v. Facebook, Inc.) seeking to enjoin the FTC from further pursuing its agency process to modify the modified consent order. On\\nNovember 27, 2023, the district court denied our motion, and we then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (U.S. v.\\nFacebook, Inc.) and sought to stay the FTC proceeding pending resolution of the appeal. Our motion for a stay pending appeal was denied in March 2024. The\\nunderlying appeal was then briefed and oral argument was held on November 5, 2024. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has yet to\\nrule.\\nOn November 29, 2023, we separately filed a complaint, also in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (Meta Platforms, Inc. v. FTC),\\nasserting constitutional challenges to the structure of the FTC, and seeking to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation. On\\nDecember 13, 2023, the FTC filed an opposition to our motion for preliminary injunction and a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 14, 2024, the\\ndistrict court denied our motion to preliminarily enjoin the FTC proceeding during the pendency of the litigation, and also denied the FTC's motion to dismiss\\nour complaint without prejudice, pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in SEC v. Jarkesy (Jarkesy). Our motion for a stay of the FTC proceeding pending\\nappeal was denied in March 2024. Both the district court action and the appeal were stayed pending the Supreme Court's decision in Jarkesy. Following the\\nSupreme Court's ruling in Jarkesy on June 27, 2024, the government filed a renewed motion to dismiss, which was fully briefed as of October 18, 2024. The\\ndistrict court has yet to rule. The parties are required to report back to the circuit court within 30 days of the district court's disposition of the FTC's motion to\\ndismiss.\\n111\"),\n",

Per FTC orders, we completed briefing on threshold legal issues on July 18, 2024, and the FTC held oral argument before the Commissioners\\non those issues on November 12, 2024. On January 10, 2025, the Commission issued a decision on certain threshold legal issues, including that the\\nCommission has statutory authority to modify consent orders. The Commission stated that its decision is subject to Meta’s jurisdictional challenges currently\\npending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in U.S. v. Facebook, Inc., and that the nature and scope of any further\\nadministrative proceedings would be addressed at a later date. Through the administrative process, the FTC could amend the order to impose the additional\\nrequirements set forth in the proposed order. We should have the opportunity to appeal an FTC decision modifying the order and could request the appellate\\ncourt to stay the enforcement of the modifications to the order while the appeal is pending. It is unclear whether the appeal or the request for a stay would be\\nsuccessful.\\nWe also notify the Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC), our lead European Union privacy regulator under the General Data Protection Regulation\\n(GDPR), of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, issue similar notifications to European regulators under other laws (such as UK GDPR and\\nMember State implementations of the ePrivacy Directive), and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the IDPC and other European regulators regarding\\nvarious aspects of our regulatory compliance. For example, the IDPC is continuing to assess the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" consent model\\nwith requirements under the GDPR. In addition, on May 12, 2023, the IDPC issued a Final Decision concluding that Meta Platforms Ireland\\'s reliance on\\nStandard Contractual Clauses in respect of certain transfers of European Economic Area (EEA) Facebook user data was not in compliance with the GDPR. The\\nIDPC issued an administrative fine of EUR €1.2 billion as well as corrective orders, which is described further in \"Legal Proceedings\" contained in Part I, Item\\n3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The interpretation of the GDPR is still evolving, including through decisions of the Court of Justice of the European\\nUnion, and draft decisions in investigations by the IDPC are subject to review by other European privacy regulators as part of the GDPR\\'s cooperation and\\nconsistency mechanisms, which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations. As a result, the interpretation and enforcement of\\nthe GDPR, as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for non-compliance, are subject to significant uncertainty. Although we are vigorously defending\\nour regulatory compliance, we have accrued significant amounts for loss contingencies related to these inquiries and investigations in Europe, and we believe\\nthere is a reasonable possibility that additional accruals for losses related to these matters could be material individually or in the aggregate.\\nBeginning on June 7, 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we improperly received individuals\\' information from\\nthird-party websites or apps via our business tools in violation of our terms and various state and federal laws and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive\\nrelief (for example, In re Meta Pixel Healthcare Litigation; In re Meta Pixel Tax Filing Cases; Frasco v. Flo Health, Inc.; Doe v. Hey Favor, Inc. et al.; Doe v.\\nGoodRx Holdings, Inc. et al. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California; and Rickwalder, et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. in the Santa Clara\\nCounty Superior Court). These cases are in different stages, but several of our motions to dismiss have been denied in whole or in part, while certain others\\nhave been granted in whole or in part. We are currently in discovery and litigating class certification in the cases that are most advanced.\\nCompetition\\nWe are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States,\\nEurope, and other jurisdictions. Such investigations, inquiries, and lawsuits concern, among other things, our business practices in the areas of social\\nnetworking or social media services, digital advertising, and/or mobile or online applications, as well as our acquisitions. For example, in 2019 we became the\\nsubject of antitrust investigations by the FTC and U.S. Department of Justice. On December 9, 2020, the FTC filed a complaint (FTC v. Meta Platforms, Inc.)\\nagainst us in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in\\nviolation of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and Section 2 of the Sherman Act, including by acquiring Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in\\n2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform. The FTC sought a permanent injunction against our company\\'s alleged violations of the antitrust\\nlaws, and other equitable relief, including divestiture or reconstruction of Instagram and WhatsApp. On June 28, 2021, the court granted our motion to dismiss\\nthe complaint filed by the FTC with leave to amend. On August 19, 2021, the FTC filed an amended complaint, and on October 4, 2021, we filed a motion to\\ndismiss this amended complaint. On January 11, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the FTC\\'s amended complaint. On April 5, 2024, we filed our\\nmotion for summary judgment and the FTC filed its opposition and its own motion for partial summary judgment on May 24, 2024. On November 13, 2024,\\nthe court granted in part and denied in part both our and the FTC\\'s motions for summary judgment. Trial is set to begin on April 14, 2025.

Several of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users in the United States\\nwere consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Klein et al., v. Meta Platforms, Inc.). On January 14, 2022, the court\\ngranted, in part, and denied, in part, our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions. On March 1, 2022, a first amended consolidated complaint was filed in the\\nputative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 6, 2022, the court denied our motion to dismiss the first amended consolidated\\ncomplaint filed in the putative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers. On December 30, 2024, we filed our motion for summary judgment in the\\nputative class action brought on behalf of certain advertisers.\\nIn December 2022, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections alleging that we tie Facebook Marketplace to Facebook and use data in a\\nmanner that infringes European Union competition rules. On November 18, 2024, the European Commission issued a decision that Meta infringed Article 102\\non the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union in relation to certain alleged business practices relating to Facebook Marketplace and imposed a fine of\\napproximately EUR €798 million. We appealed the European Commission\\'s decision on January 28, 2025.\\nIn March 2024, the European Commission opened an investigation into the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" consent model with\\nrequirements under Article 5(2) of the Digital Markets Act. The European Commission issued preliminary findings on July 1, 2024 reflecting its preliminary\\nview that our model does not comply with such requirements, and indicated that it will conclude its investigation by March 2025.\\nSecurities and Other Actions\\nBeginning on March 20, 2018, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the United States and\\nelsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in\\nconnection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of\\nour terms and policies, and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief. Beginning on July 27, 2018, two putative class actions were filed in federal court\\nin the United States against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings\\nresults for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages. These two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the U.S. District\\nCourt for the Northern District of California (In Re Facebook, Inc. Securities Litigation) with the putative securities class action described above relating to our\\nplatform and user data practices. In a series of orders in 2019 and 2020, the district court granted our motions to dismiss the plaintiffs\\' claims. On January 17,\\n2022, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case, and on October 18, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit issued\\nits decision affirming in part and reversing in part the district court\\'s order dismissing the plaintiffs\\' case. We filed a petition for writ of certiorari on March 4,\\n2024 with the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking review of the Ninth Circuit\\'s order. The Supreme Court granted in part our petition for writ of certiorari on June 10,\\n2024, and following oral argument issued an order on November 22, 2024 dismissing the grant of certiorari as improvidently granted.\\nWe are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices. For example, beginning\\nin September 2021, we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to a former employee\\'s allegations and release of internal company\\ndocuments concerning, among other things, our algorithms, advertising and user metrics, and content enforcement practices, as well as misinformation and\\nother undesirable activity on our platform, and user well-being. We have since received additional requests relating to these and other topics. Beginning on\\nOctober 27, 2021, multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us\\nand certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duties, and other causes of action in connection with the same\\nmatters, and seeking unspecified damages (Ohio Pub. Empl. Ret. Sys. v. Meta Platforms, Inc.).

Putative class actions have been filed in the United States, Brazil, and Canada on behalf of users in those jurisdictions, and numerous school\\ndistricts, municipalities, and tribal nations have filed public nuisance claims in the United States, Brazil, and/or Canada based on similar allegations. On\\nOctober 6, 2022, the U.S. federal cases were centralized in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (In re Social Media Adolescent\\nAddiction Product Liability Personal Injury Litigation). Beginning in March 2023, U.S. states and territories began filing lawsuits on these topics in various\\nfederal and state courts. These additional lawsuits include allegations regarding violations of the Children\\'s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), child\\nsexual abuse material and other child safety concerns, as well as violations of state consumer protection laws, unfair business practices, public nuisance, and\\nproducts liability, with proceedings focused on our alleged business practices (including the use of end-to-end encryption) and harms to users under 18 years\\nold. These lawsuits seek damages and injunctive relief, and include cases filed by various state attorneys general in In re Social Media Adolescent Addiction\\nProduct Liability Personal Injury Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, as well as various state courts around the country.\\nBeginning in November 2024, counsel for thousands of individual claimants began sending mass arbitration demands relating to “social media addiction” and\\nrelated harms allegedly caused by Instagram.\\nWe are also subject to government investigations and requests from multiple regulators in various jurisdictions globally concerning the use of our\\nproducts and services, and the alleged mental and physical health and safety impacts on users, particularly younger users. On May 16, 2024, the European\\nCommission opened formal proceedings assessing our compliance with certain requirements under Articles 28, 34, and 35 of the Digital Services Act (DSA),\\nincluding the way in which we identified, assessed, and mitigated against certain systemic risks to minors and other vulnerable users that may stem from the\\ndesign and functioning of Instagram and Facebook.\\nOther Actions\\nBeginning on August 15, 2018, multiple putative class actions were filed against us alleging that we inflated our estimates of the potential audience size\\nfor advertisements, resulting in artificially increased demand and higher prices. The cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District\\nof California (DZ Reserve v. Facebook, Inc.) and seek unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In a series of rulings in 2019, 2021, and 2022, the court\\ndismissed certain of the plaintiffs\\' claims, but permitted their fraud and unfair competition claims to proceed.

In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation\\nand bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations.\\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification\\nclaims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by us under these agreements have not had a\\nmaterial impact on our consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, as of December 31, 2024, there was not a reasonable possibility we had incurred a\\nmaterial loss with respect to indemnification of such parties.

During all years presented, we recognized interest and\\npenalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on our consolidated statements of income. The amount of interest and\\npenalties accrued as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $2.21 billion, $1.48 billion, and $1.07 billion, respectively.\\nIf our gross unrecognized tax benefits of $15.13 billion as of December 31, 2024 were realized in a future period, this would result in a tax benefit of\\n$10.11 billion within our provision of income taxes at such time.\\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States and various other state and foreign jurisdictions. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to\\npotential examination include the United States and Ireland. We are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for our 2017 through 2019 tax\\nyears. Our 2014 through 2016 tax years are with the IRS Independent Office of Appeals for certain unresolved issues. Our 2020 and subsequent tax years\\nremain open to examination by the IRS. We are under examination by the Irish Revenue Commissioners for our 2020 tax year and our 2021 and subsequent tax\\nyears remain open to examination.\\nIn July 2016, we received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction\\nwith the examination of the 2010 tax year. While the Notice applies only to the 2010 tax year, the IRS stated that it will also apply its position for tax years\\nsubsequent to 2010 and has done so in years covered by the second Notice described below. We do not agree with the position of the IRS and have filed a\\npetition in the Tax Court challenging the Notice. On January 15, 2020, the IRS's amendment to answer was filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an\\nadjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the Notice. The first session of the trial was completed in March 2020 and the final trial session was\\ncompleted in August 2022. We expect the Tax Court to issue an opinion in 2025 which will likely provide a transfer pricing value for intellectual property\\ntransferred. This value will need to be extrapolated into income adjustments to determine the specific tax liability, which will likely remain in dispute and will\\nnot be resolved until the Tax Court enters a decision. If the IRS prevails in its updated position, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an\\nestimated, aggregate amount of up to approximately $9.0 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. return, plus interest and any penalties\\nasserted. Once the Tax Court decision is entered, the IRS and Meta will each have the option to file an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\\nIn March 2018, we received a second Notice from the IRS in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years. The IRS applied its\\nposition from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and\\ncertain tax credits that we claimed. If the IRS prevails in its position for these new adjustments, this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to\\napproximately $680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed U.S. returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. We do not agree with the\\npositions of the IRS in the second Notice and have filed a petition in the Tax Court challenging the second Notice.\\nWe have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740), that is lower than\\nthe potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the IRS in the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. In addition, if the IRS prevails\\nin its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax\\nthat we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. As of December 31, 2024, we have not\\nresolved these matters and proceedings continue in the Tax Court.\\nWe believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with ASC 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax\\nitems that may ultimately result from these examinations. The timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of any audits is highly uncertain, and it is\\nreasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining\\nthat are subject to examination, we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If the tax\\nauthorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due, the assessed tax, interest, and penalties, if any, could have a material adverse impact on our financial\\nposition, results of operations, and cash flows.\\n120\"),\n",

Background and Purpose\\nA.Why have we adopted this policy?\\nThis policy has been adopted to help you comply with the federal securities laws and to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. Under the securities laws, it\\nis generally illegal for any person to trade in the securities of Meta Platforms, Inc. (“Meta” or the “Company”) or any other company while in the possession of\\nmaterial non-public information about that company. It is also generally illegal for any such person to give material non-public information about Meta or any\\nother company to others who then trade on the basis of that information. The consequences of prohibited insider trading or the “tipping” of material non-public\\ninformation can be severe for both individuals engaging in such behavior and for Meta. Violators, as well as Meta, its directors and officers and/or the\\nmanagers of the person violating the rules may be required to pay major civil or criminal penalties (including jail time) and could be subject to private lawsuits\\nin connection with the violation of the insider trading laws.\\nB.What is insider trading?\\n“Insider trading” occurs when any person PURCHASES or SELLS Meta securities on the basis of material non-public information concerning Meta, or from\\ntipping (directly or indirectly passing on) material non-public information to others. Meta securities include not only stocks, but also include options, restricted\\nstock units (“RSUs”), warrants, bonds and notes as well as derivative securities that are not issued by Meta, such as exchange-traded put or call options or\\nswaps relating to Meta’s securities. “Purchase” includes not only the actual purchase of a security, but any contract to purchase or otherwise acquire a security.\\n“Sale” includes not only the actual sale of a security, but any contract to sell or otherwise dispose of a security.\\nDoes this policy also apply to securities of other companies?\\nInsider trading on the basis of material non-public information about Meta is prohibited under this policy. In connection with your work at Meta, you may also\\nlearn material non-public information about other companies. This policy also prohibits trading in those companies' securities on the basis of material non-\\npublic information about those companies learned through your employment at Meta, and prohibits tipping (directly or indirectly passing on) material non-\\npublic information about those companies to others.\\nNote that if you learn material non-public information that affects multiple other companies, you may not trade the securities of any of those companies. For\\nexample, say you learn that Meta has plans to acquire Company A. The acquisition is not material to Meta but it is material non-public information about\\nCompany A. There is also a Company B in the same industry that is economically linked to Company A, such that the announcement of the acquisition of\\nCompany A could be expected to affect the stock price of Company B. This policy prohibits trading in securities of both Company A and Company B while in\\npossession of that material non-public information.\\nC.What is “Material Non-public Information”?\\nInformation concerning Meta is considered “MATERIAL” if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider the information\\nimportant in making a decision to purchase or sell Meta’s securities. Material information can be positive or negative and can relate to virtually any aspect of\\nMeta’s business. \\nExamples of material information may include (but are not limited to) facts concerning:\\n•historical or forecasted revenues, earnings or other financial results;\\n•significant new products or services or other product developments;\\n•significant new contracts, customers or partners or the loss of a significant contract, customer or partner;\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'F:\\\\Multi-User Document Search and Conversational Q&A System\\\\data\\\\Meta\\\\Meta.pdf'}, page_content='•significant developments regarding Meta’s technology or business operations;\\n•significant, sustained changes in user growth and engagement;\\n•possible mergers or acquisitions or dispositions of significant subsidiaries or assets, tender offers, joint ventures, restructurings or curtailment of\\noperations; \\n•pending or threatened significant litigation or regulatory inquiries or developments in existing litigation or inquiries; \\n•significant cybersecurity incidents or data breaches;\\n•significant developments in borrowings, or financings or capital investments; \\n•significant changes in financial condition or asset value or liquidity issues;\\n•changes in debt ratings, or analyst upgrades or downgrades of Meta or its securities; \\n•changes in senior management; \\n•significant changes in corporate strategy; \\n•changes in accounting methods and write-offs; and \\n•stock offerings, stock splits or changes in dividend policy.  \\nThis list is illustrative only and is not intended to provide a comprehensive list of circumstances that could result in material information. Determination of\\nwhat may constitute material information will depend upon the facts and circumstances in each particular situation.\\nInformation is “NON-PUBLIC” if it is not available to the general public. In order for information to be considered public, it must be generally available to\\ninvestors and widely disseminated through (i) press releases or corporate blog posts issued by Meta, publicly accessible webcasts or conference calls conducted\\nby Meta or a public filing made by Meta with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), or (ii) publication in a widely-available newspaper, news\\nmagazine or news website. In addition, a sufficient amount of time must pass so that the information has had an opportunity to be digested by the marketplace.\\nAs a general rule, information should not be considered fully absorbed by the marketplace until one (1) full trading day after the release of such information.\\nOne helpful way to determine if you have material non-public information is to ask yourself, “Would the person on the other side of this transaction\\nstill want to complete the trade at this price if he or she knew what I know about Meta?” If the answer is “no,” chances are you possess material non-\\npublic information.\\nA good general rule of thumb: WHEN IN DOUBT, DO NOT TRADE.\\nD.Who is covered under this policy?\\nIf you fall under any of the categories below, you are subject to this policy:\\n•directors, officers and employees of Meta and its subsidiaries;\\n•spouses, domestic partners, dependent children (whether or not minors) and any other family members who live in the same household of any persons\\nlisted in the bullet above;\\n•consultants and contractors of Meta and its subsidiaries; and\\n•any persons or entities or accounts controlled by any of the above or which investment decisions are directed or influenced by any of the above.\\nAny trades in Meta securities made on your behalf, including trades by brokers or other third parties, are subject to this policy, and it is your responsibility to\\nensure all such trading activity is in compliance with this policy. You should also be aware that trades in Meta securities by other members of your immediate\\nfamily (e.g. parents or siblings) as well as unrelated members of your household may be heavily scrutinized based on their proximity to'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'F:\\\\Multi-User Document Search and Conversational Q&A System\\\\data\\\\Meta\\\\Meta.pdf'}, page_content='you. In an insider trading investigation, the burden of proof is often on the insider to prove that trades made by such persons were not the result of information\\nthat the insider may have possessed. Accordingly, while we don’t expect you to monitor what is outside of your control, if you are concerned about this\\npossibility, we suggest that you send a message to these people informing them of Meta’s regular closed trading period and ask them to comply with the closed\\ntrading period.\\nE.Who administers this policy?\\nThe Company’s Chief Legal Officer administers this policy and serves as the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer (the “Insider Trading Policy\\nCompliance Officer”). In his or her absence, Meta’s Chief Financial Officer will serve as the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer. The Insider Trading\\nPolicy Compliance Officer may also designate one or more individuals in the legal department who may perform the functions of the Insider Trading Policy\\nCompliance Officer. The Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer will review and either approve or prohibit all proposed trades requiring preapproval under\\nthis policy according to the procedures set forth in this policy, except that with respect to the Chief Legal Officer, any proposed trades must be approved by\\nMeta’s Chief Financial Officer. All determinations and interpretations by the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer will be final and not subject to further\\nreview.\\nII. Insider Trading Policies\\nOVERRIDING RULE: NO ONE CAN TRADE META SECURITIES WHILE IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL NON-PUBLIC INFORMATION,\\nAND NO ONE CAN HELP OR ENCOURAGE ANYONE TO TRADE META SECURITIES WHILE IN POSSESSION OF MATERIAL NON-\\nPUBLIC INFORMATION.\\nA. No Trading on Material Non-public Information\\nIf you possess material non-public information, you may not purchase or sell, including any offer to purchase or offer to sell, any of Meta’s securities, during\\nany period beginning with the date you received the material non-public information concerning Meta, and ending at market open on the second full trading\\nday after public disclosure of that information, or at such time when the non-public information is no longer material.\\nB. No Trading During Closed Trading Periods; Pre-Clearance of Certain Transactions\\n1. Regular Closed Trading Period\\nYou may not trade in any security of Meta during the period beginning at market close on the last day of the middle month of any fiscal quarter of Meta and\\nending at market open on the second full trading day after the public release of earnings data for such fiscal quarter (a “Regular Closed Trading Period”). For\\nexample, if Meta announces its prior fiscal quarter earnings on the afternoon of Wednesday, July 28th, then the Regular Closed Trading Period will end at\\nmarket open on Friday, July 30th, and you would potentially be able to trade in the “open trading window” from Friday, July 30th through market close on\\nAugust 31st. However, these open trading windows should not be considered a safe harbor, as you are always restricted from trading under this policy if you\\npossess material non-public information, even during open trading windows. \\n2. Special Closed Trading Period\\nThe Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer may suspend trading in Meta securities from time to time for some or all persons subject to this policy because\\nof material developments known to Meta or certain persons within Meta and not yet disclosed to the public, as he or she deems appropriate (a “Special Closed\\nTrading Period” and together with a Regular Closed Trading Period, a “Closed Trading Period”), and need not provide any reason for such suspension. The\\nInsider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or his or her designee will notify you if you are subject to a Special Closed Trading Period, and may not explain the\\nreasons. \\n3. Pre-Clearance of Trades of Restricted Persons\\nIn addition to being subject to the Closed Trading Periods described above, and subject to the 10b5-1 Trading Plan requirements for 10b5-1 Designated Persons\\ndescribed below, all members of the Company’s Board of Directors and “Section 16 officers” (as defined below) and certain other designated employees,\\nconsultants and contractors'),\n",

These Restricted Persons\\nmust contact the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer prior to commencing any trade in Meta’s securities. The Company will notify you if you are on the\\nPre-Clear List.\\nApproval of trades by Restricted Persons on the Pre-Clear List is in the sole discretion of Meta. If a transaction is approved, you must execute the transaction\\nwithin five (5) trading days after the day you receive such approval, but in no event after the commencement of a Closed Trading Period. If for any reason you\\ndo not complete the trade within five (5) trading days after you receive approval, you must obtain pre-clearance again before you can trade the securities. For\\nexample, if the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or his or her designee approves a trade on a Friday, then you will have until the end of the trading\\nday the following Friday to complete your trade.\\nAny requests to approve a trade while you are subject to a Closed Trading Period will be denied.\\n4. Pre-Clearance of Gifts by 10b5-1 Designated Persons\\nAll 10b5-1 Designated Persons must also pre-clear all gifts of Meta securities and transfers of Meta securities for estate planning purposes with the Insider\\nTrading Policy Compliance Officer or his or her designee prior to such transfer, even during an open trading window.\\nC. No Tipping\\nYou may not tip (i.e. directly or indirectly pass on) material non-public information to any other person where the information may be used by such person to\\ntrade in the securities to which such information relates. You may not make recommendations or express opinions as to trading in Meta’s securities. For\\nexample, you may not suggest, encourage or recommend that others buy or sell Meta’s securities (or that they refrain from buying or selling in any setting),\\nincluding through participation in any investment or stock-related Meta group, message board or other similar medium.\\nD. No Margining or Pledging of Company Securities\\nYou may not hold Meta securities in margin accounts or pledge such securities as collateral for a loan except in limited circumstances as approved by the\\nCompensation, Nominating, & Governance Committee. However, you may maintain a margin account so long as you do not hold Meta securities in the\\naccount, or otherwise use the account to trade Meta securities on margin, or otherwise use Meta securities as collateral.\\nE. No Trading in Futures or Derivative Securities or Hedging\\nYou may not purchase or sell futures or derivative securities relating to Meta securities, or engage in hedging activities relating to Meta securities, including\\nexchange traded options to purchase or sell such securities, puts, calls, collars, forward sale contracts, equity swaps, exchange funds, or other arrangements or\\ninstruments designed to hedge or offset decreases in the market value of Meta securities.\\nInvestments in mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) that track a broad-based index (such as the S&P 500) and/or have holdings comprised of less\\nthan 10% in Meta stock are exempt from this policy. However, investments in any other mutual fund or ETF where Meta stock comprises 10% or more of such\\nfund’s holdings are subject to this policy and shares of such mutual fund or ETF are treated as if they were Meta securities.\\nF. No Short Sales\\nYou may not sell Meta securities “short” (meaning any transaction in which you would benefit from a decline in the price of the securities).\\nG. No Trading on Information Regarding Other Companies\\nIf you, in the course of working for Meta, learn of material non-public information about another company, you may not trade in that company’s securities until\\nthe information becomes public or is no longer material. You should treat'),\n",

Confidentiality of Non-public Information\\nNon-public information relating to Meta is the property of Meta and the unauthorized disclosure or improper use of such information is forbidden. You may not\\ndisclose material non-public information to other persons within Meta whose jobs do not require them to have that information, or outside of Meta to other\\npersons, unless such disclosure is made in accordance with Meta’s policies regarding the protection or unauthorized external disclosure of information\\nregarding Meta. In addition, your confidentiality agreement with Meta provides that Meta confidential information will only be used for the benefit of the\\ncompany and solely to the extent necessary to perform your job. Any other use—such as trading on such information for personal benefit/profit—is prohibited.\\nIn addition to violating this policy and/or your confidentiality agreement, any unauthorized disclosures or improper use of such information may also violate\\nMeta’s agreements with third parties and may be in breach of your fiduciary, loyalty or other duties to Meta. \\nIII. Exceptions to Trading Restrictions\\nA.10b5-1 Trading Plans\\nTransactions in Meta’s securities that are executed pursuant to an approved trading plan established pursuant to SEC Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities\\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (a “10b5-1 Trading Plan”), will not be subject to this policy. SEC Rule 10b5-1 generally provides an affirmative defense\\nfrom insider trading liability under the federal securities laws for securities trading plans that are entered into in good faith when you are not in possession of\\nmaterial non-public information and with respect to which you act in good faith for the duration of the plan.\\nThe 10b5-1 Trading Plan must either specify the amount, pricing and timing of transactions in advance or include a written formula or algorithm, or computer\\nprogram, for determining the number of shares, prices and dates. Once a 10b5-1 Trading Plan is adopted, you must not exercise any subsequent influence over\\nthe amount of securities to be traded, the price at which they are to be traded or the date of any trades under the plan. All 10b5-1 Trading Plans, including any\\nmodifications, terminations, or other changes of such plans, must be pre-approved by the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or his or her designee and\\nmay only be adopted, modified or terminated when you are not subject to a Closed Trading Period and not in possession of material non-public information.\\nSubject to the Transition Period and Affiliated Fund Exclusion provisions described in the Company’s 10b5-1 Trading Plan Policy, “10b5-1 Designated\\nPersons” (as defined below) are required to conduct all purchase and sale transactions involving Meta’s securities, including the sale of Meta securities that\\nthey control through a trust or other entity, through a 10b5-1 Trading Plan and shall not be entitled to conduct transactions in open trading windows outside of a\\n10b5-1 Trading Plan. However, bona fide gifts, any transfers pursuant to a divorce settlement/agreement or other similar court order, or transfers for estate\\nplanning purposes by 10b5-1 Designated Persons need not be conducted under a 10b5-1 Trading Plan. In addition, sales by foundations or other charitable\\nentities controlled by 10b5-1 Designated Persons of shares received as a result of a bona fide gift need not be conducted under a 10b5-1 Trading Plan if (a) the\\nunderlying gift was effected during an open trading window and (b) the decision to sell such gifted securities is made by an independent investment committee\\nwithout any consultation with or influence of the transferor. For purposes of this policy, “10b5-1 Designated Persons” means the following individuals: (i)\\nmembers of Meta’s Board of Directors, (ii) Meta’s “officers” as defined under Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\\namended (collectively, “Section 16 officers”), and (iii) certain other individuals (such as members of management who report directly to Meta’s Chief\\nExecutive Officer) who may be designated from time to time by joint approval of the Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\\nFor more information, see Meta’s 10b5-1 Trading Plan Policy.\\nB.Bona Fide Gifts and Other Transfers Without Consideration\\nBona fide gifts or other transfers without consideration are exempt from this policy; provided that, for gifts or other transfers without consideration made (i) in\\na Closed Trading Period or (ii) at a time when you possess material non-public information, the recipient must agree not to sell Meta securities before the\\nearliest time after the gift is completed that you are permitted to sell Meta securities on the open market under this policy.

It is the responsibility of each affected director and the affiliated entity, in consultation with their own counsel, to determine the process and timing for\\nany such distributions based on all relevant facts and circumstances and applicable securities laws.\\nE.Company Incentive Plans \\nThis policy does not apply to (i) the vesting or settlement of RSUs, (ii) the exercise of a tax withholding right pursuant to which Meta elects to withhold shares\\nof stock to satisfy tax withholding requirements upon the vesting of any RSUs or (iii) a sell to cover transaction (x) under which you have previously elected to\\nhave a broker sell vested RSUs to cover any applicable tax withholding requirements (so long as such sell to cover election was made in an open window and\\nwhen you were not in possession of material non-public information) or (y) which is otherwise mandated by Meta. This policy does apply, however, to any sale\\nof Meta shares that you actually receive upon vesting and settlement of your RSUs.\\nIV. Penalties for Violation\\nViolation of the rules in this policy is grounds for disciplinary action by Meta, including termination of employment. Trading on or tipping (i.e. directly or\\nindirectly passing on) material non-public information can also result in disgorgement of all profits and the imposition of substantial fines, extending\\nsignificantly beyond any profits made or losses avoided, both for you and Meta. \\nV. Individual Responsibility\\nYou are individually responsible for complying with this policy, including the determination of whether you possess material non-public information. You may,\\nfrom time to time, have to forego a proposed transaction in Meta’s securities even if you had planned to make the transaction before learning of any material\\nnon-public information and even though you believe you may suffer an economic loss or forego anticipated profit by waiting. \\nNone of Meta, the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or Meta’s other employees will have any liability for any delay in reviewing, or refusal of, a\\nrequest for pre-clearance of any potential trade or a trading plan. Notwithstanding any review of any pre-clearance of a transaction or any review of a trading\\nplan, none of Meta, the Insider Trading Policy Compliance Officer or Meta’s other employees assumes any liability for the legality or consequences of such\\ntrading plan or transaction to your engagement in or adoption of such transaction or trading plan. \\nVI. Inquiries\\nPlease direct all inquiries regarding any of the provisions or procedures of this policy to the Meta legal department. \\nVII. Amendments and Waivers\\nAmendments to this policy, and waivers requested by any director or Section 16 officer of Meta, must be approved by action of the Board of Directors or the\\nCompensation, Nominating & Governance Committee.

What is a 10b5-1 Trading Plan?\\nAs provided in the Insider Trading Policy, transactions in Meta’s securities that are executed pursuant to an approved 10b5-1 Trading Plan will not be\\nsubject to the restrictions of the Insider Trading Policy, and SEC Rule 10b5-1 generally provides an affirmative defense from insider trading liability\\nunder the federal securities laws for securities trading plans meeting certain conditions, that are entered into in good faith when you are not in\\npossession of material non-public information and with respect to which you act in good faith for the duration of the plan.\\nC. How does a 10b5-1 Trading Plan Work?\\nThe 10b5-1 Trading Plan must either specify the amount, pricing and timing of transactions in advance or delegate discretion on those matters to an\\nindependent third party. Once a 10b5-1 Trading Plan is adopted, you must not exercise any influence over the amount of securities to be traded, the\\nprice at which they are to be traded or the date of any trades under the plan. All 10b5-1 Trading Plans, including any modification or other change of\\nsuch plans, must be pre-approved by the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer (as set forth in Section II(H) below) and may only be adopted or modified when\\nyou are not subject to a Closed Trading Period and not in possession of material non-public information.\\nD. Am I required to adopt a 10b5-1 Trading Plan? Am I subject to this policy if I am not required to adopt a 10b5-1 Trading Plan, but\\ndecide to do so voluntarily?\\nSubject to the Transition Period and Affiliated Fund Exclusion provisions described below, “10b5-1 Designated Persons” (as defined below) are\\nrequired to conduct all purchase and sale transactions involving Meta’s securities, including the sale of Meta securities that they control through a trust\\nor other entity, through a 10b5-1 Trading Plan and will not be entitled to conduct transactions in open trading windows outside of a 10b5-1 Trading\\nPlan. However, bona fide gifts, any transfers pursuant to a divorce settlement/agreement or other similar court order, or transfers for estate planning\\npurposes by 10b5-1 Designated Persons need not be conducted under a 10b5-1 Trading Plan. In addition, sales by foundations or other charitable\\nentities controlled by 10b5-1 Designated Persons of shares received as a result of a bona fide gift need not be conducted under a 10b5-1 Trading Plan\\nif (a) the underlying gift was effected during an open trading window while not in possession of material non-public information and (b) the decision\\nto sell such gifted securities is made by an independent investment committee without any consultation with or influence of the transferor. For\\npurposes of this policy, “10b5-1 Designated Persons” means the following'),\n",

An immediate family member of a director includes such director’s spouse (or spousal equivalent), parents, stepparents,\\nchildren, stepchildren, siblings, dependents, mothers- and fathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law, brothers- and sisters-in-law, and any person\\n(other than a tenant or employee) sharing the director’s household.\\nTransition Period: If an individual is appointed to an employee role that is designated as a 10b5-1 Designated Person, or an employee is otherwise\\ndesignated as a 10b5-1 Designated Person for the first time, such employee will be entitled to trade Meta securities outside of a 10b5-1 Trading Plan:\\n(a) if appointed or designated during an open trading window, for the remainder of such open trading window, or (b) if appointed or designated during\\na closed trading window, for the duration of the next open trading window following such appointment or designation; provided however, that the\\nforegoing transition period will not apply to any person appointed to a role that is designated a Section 16 officer position and will not apply to any\\nperson who was already required to conduct all trades of Meta securities through a 10b5-1 Trading Plan under this policy.\\nE. Who should I contact with questions about 10b5-1 Trading Plans?\\nMeta’s Chief Legal Officer administers this policy and Meta’s 10b5-1 Plan Standards (attached hereto as Exhibit A), and serves as the 10b5-1\\nCompliance Officer (the “10b5-1 Compliance Officer”). In the Chief Legal Officer’s absence, Meta’s Chief Financial Officer will serve as the 10b5-1\\nCompliance Officer. The 10b5-1 Compliance Officer may also designate one or more individuals in the legal department who may perform the\\nfunctions of the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer. All determinations and interpretations by the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer will be final and not subject to\\nfurther review.\\nII. 10b5-1 TRADING PLANS – CONDITIONS OF IMPLEMENTATION\\nA person subject to the Insider Trading Policy may adopt a 10b5-1 Trading Plan and engage in transactions in Meta securities pursuant to such plan\\nprovided that each of the following conditions is satisfied and the general terms and circumstances of such plan are consistent with Meta’s 10b5-1\\nPlan Standards, attached here to as Exhibit A.\\nA. Intended to Satisfy the Affirmative Defense Conditions of Rule 10b5-1\\nThe 10b5-1 Trading Plan must be intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1(c) and comply with the\\nrequirements of said Rule 10b5-1(c) and include a statement to that general effect which includes, but is not limited to, the fact that the plan was\\nentered into in good faith and that you will act in good faith with respect to the plan for the duration of the plan.\\nB. Formulaic Execution or No Exercise of Discretion\\nWith respect to any transaction in Meta securities, the 10b5-1 Trading Plan either (i) expressly specifies the amount, price and date, (ii) provides a\\nwritten formula or algorithm, or computer program, for determining amounts, prices and dates, or (iii) does not permit the person subject to this policy\\nto exercise any subsequent influence over how, when, or whether to effect such purchase or sale, but does allow this'),\n",

This\\naligns with Meta’s use of Charles Schwab as Meta’s sole broker for the Meta equity program. By limiting employees and directors to the selected broker\\nfor this purpose, Meta hopes to reduce employee fees, facilitate use of 10b5-1 plans by all interested employees, ease administration of plans, and enable\\nthe execution of transactions in a more orderly fashion. Charles Schwab shall provide a form of 10b5-1 plan document for use by employees and directors,\\nas discussed further in Section 2, below.\\n2.Overlapping Plans; Specific Plan Standards for the Broker: Each individual can only have one (1) active trading plan in place at a time. In addition,\\neach individual can only have one (1) “single trade” 10b5-1 trading plan during any 12-month period. If you control, or direct or influence investment\\ndecisions of, any trust or other entity, you may not enter into a separate trading plan for the trust or other entity, but you may include the shares held by\\nsuch trust or other entity in your individual plan.\\nIn addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, an individual may enter into a second trading plan so long as such second plan does not begin trading until after\\nall trades under the first plan are completed or expired without execution.\\nPlans with Charles Schwab typically utilize specified determinants regarding date(s), prices(s), start and end dates and share amounts to be sold under the\\n10b5-1 plan using a template provided by Charles Schwab. Plans with Charles Schwab cannot include determinants that are derived through employee or\\ndirector-provided formulas or algorithms, but can include volume weighted average price (VWAP).\\n3.Number of Shares: There is no limitation on the number of shares that a 10b5-1 plan can cover; however, each individual share of stock can only be\\ncovered by one (1) 10b5-1 plan. In addition, there must be a sufficient number of shares in the 10b5-1-related brokerage account to cover any balance of\\nshares available for sale under the applicable 10b5-1 plan.\\n4.Duration: A 10b5-1 plan cannot have a duration longer than two years.\\n5.Absolute Discretion of the 10b5-1 Compliance Officer: The 10b5-1 Compliance Officer shall have absolute discretion to suspend an employee or\\ndirector’s eligibility under this policy or otherwise take appropriate measures in the event that an employee or director appears to be cancelling or\\nmodifying their plan(s) in a serial fashion and/or in a manner that is not in keeping with the spirit of Rule 10b5-1.\\n6.Further Guidance for Section 16 Officers: Employees designated by Meta as subject to the disclosure requirements of Section 16 of the Securities and\\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended, and directors should be mindful of SEC filing requirements and stockholder concerns when designing their 10b5-1\\nplans.'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'F:\\\\Multi-User Document Search and Conversational Q&A System\\\\data\\\\Microsoft\\\\2024_Annual_Report.pdf'}, page_content='1 Dear shareholders, colleagues, customers, and partners:  \\nFiscal year 2024 was a pivotal year for Microsoft. We entered our 50th year as a company and the second year of the AI \\nplatform shift. With these milestones, I’ve found myself reflecting on how Microsoft has remained a consequential company \\ndecade after de cade in an industry with no franchise value. And I realize that it’s because —time and time again, when tech \\nparadigms have shifted —we have seized the opportunity to reinvent ourselves to stay relevant to our customers, our \\npartners, and our employees. And that’s what we are doing again today.  \\nMicrosoft has been a platform and tools company from the start. We were founded in 1975 with a belief in creating \\ntechnology that would enable others to create their own. And, nearly 50 years later, this belief remains at the heart of our \\nmission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.   \\nThis year, we moved from talking about AI to helping our customers translate it into real outcomes —one person, one \\norganization, one institution, and one country at a time. We have made remarkable progress on this front across every \\nindustry. For example:  \\n• Coles is generating 1.6  billion daily AI predictions across 850 Australian stores, ensuring every shopper finds \\nwhat they need.  \\n• Unilever is performing thousands of simulations with AI in the time it would take to run tens of laboratory \\nexperiments, as it accelerates its product development.  \\n• Developers at Itaú, Brazil’s largest private bank, are coding more efficiently using our AI pair programmer, \\nGitHub Copilot.  \\n• Khan Academy is making tutoring more accessible for students and helping teachers plan more creative \\nlessons, using our small language model Phi.  \\n• Aquafarmers in Indonesia are improving their yields, thanks to an app built with the Azure OpenAI Service, as \\nwell as Azure IoT.  \\n• In Kenya, street vendors now have access to credit for the first time, thanks to M -Kopa, a social enterprise \\nusing Azure ML to do its forecasting.  \\n• And enterprise customers and their employees around the world, from Amgen and Disney, to Finastra and \\nVodafone, are using Microsoft 365 Copilot to become more creative and productive.  \\nFinancially, the year was also marked by record performance. We delivered over $245  billion in annual revenue, up \\n16 percent year -over-year, and over $109  billion in operating income, up 24  percent.  \\nGoing forward, we are focused on three priorities: First, prioritizing fundamentals, with security above all else. We launche d \\nthe Secure Future Initiative (SFI) this year, bringing together every part of our organization to advance cybersecurity \\nprotectio n. Second, driving trustworthy AI innovation across our entire portfolio while continuing to scale our cloud business. \\nAnd, finally, managing our cost structure dynamically to generate durable, long -term operating leverage. All three priorities \\nare critica l to our ability to continue thriving as a company as we raise the bar on our operational excellence, with a focus \\non continuous improvement across everything we do.  \\nAGE OF AI  \\nIf we go back 70 years to the beginning of modern computing, our industry has had two dreams: First, can computers \\nunderstand us instead of us having to understand computers? And second, as we digitize more of the world —including \\npeople, places, and things —can computers help us reason, plan, and act more effectively using all that information? Over \\nthe past year, we have had breakthroughs on both fronts.  \\nThe core underlying force behind these breakthroughs is scaling laws. Just like Moore’s Law drove the information \\nrevolution, the scaling laws of deep neural networks (DNN) and transformers are driving today’s AI revolution. Up until the \\nDNN inflection poi nt, progress in compute was keeping up with Moore’s Law —doubling every two years. But we have now \\nstarted to see progress in AI performance double roughly every six months.  \\n  \\nThere are three capabilities coming together because of these scaling laws. First, we have a new natural user interface that \\nis multimodal. It supports speech, images, and videos —both as input and output. We have memory that retains important \\ncontext, reca lling both our personal knowledge and data across devices, apps, and the web. And, finally, we have new'),\n",

These agents will be able to work in \\nconcert as a new input to help make small businesses more productive, make multinationals more competitive, make the \\npublic sector more efficient, and improve health and education outcomes broadly.  \\nMicrosoft has built three leading platforms to help our customers maximize their opportunity in this emerging agentic era: \\nCopilot, which you can think of as the new UI for AI —the human interface for this agentic world; the Copilot stack, which \\nbrings toge ther infrastructure, data, and app services to help customers build their own copilots and agents for their own \\nbusiness processes; and a new category of Copilot devices that are purpose -built for this new era, including the Copilot+ \\nPCs we introduced this  year.  \\nOUR OPPORTUNITY  \\nThe innovation we have driven over the past year matters only if we translate it into enduring value for our customers. That’ s \\nwhy, across our tech stack, we are focused on helping people and organizations realize the benefits of AI.  \\nInfrastructure  \\nThis year, we expanded our cloud and AI capacity, announcing new investments across five continents. These are long -\\nterm assets to drive new growth for the next decade and beyond, and ensure communities around the world have access \\nto the compute they need  to drive economic growth in this new era.  \\nOur cloud now also offers top performance for AI training and inference and the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, \\nincluding the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first -party silicon, Azure Maia, which we introduced last \\nNovember.  \\nMore broadly, we continued to see sustained revenue growth from migrations as customers turn to Azure. Azure Arc is \\nhelping customers streamline their transition, as they secure, develop, and operate workloads with Azure services \\nanywhere. We have 36,000 A rc customers, up 90  percent year -over-year. And we remain the hyperscale cloud of choice \\nfor SAP and Oracle workloads.  \\nData  & AI  \\nAI models are now key building blocks for every application. And with Azure AI, we are building out the app server for the \\nAI age, providing access to the most diverse selection of models to meet customers’ unique cost, latency, and design \\nconsiderations. We offer leading frontier models, thanks to our strategic partnership with OpenAI. With Phi -3, which we \\nannounced in April, we offer a family of powerful, small language models. And, with Models as a service, we provide API \\naccess to third -party models, in cluding the latest from Cohere, Meta, and Mistral. In total, we have over 60,000 Azure AI \\ncustomers, up nearly 60  percent year -over-year. This year, we also announced a partnership with G42, which will run its AI \\napplications and services on our cloud, as we collaborate to bring our latest AI technologies to the United Arab Emirates \\nand other countries.  \\nAI does not get created without data. At the data layer, we are fundamentally rethinking what it means to be an analytics \\ndatabase or an operational data store in the world of AI. Our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform provides customers with the  \\nbroadest  capabilities spanning databases, analytics, business intelligence, and governance —along with seamless \\nintegration with all our AI services. And Microsoft Fabric, our AI -powered, next -generation data platform we made generally \\navailable this year, now has over 14,000 paid customers who can go from data, to insights, to action —all within the same \\nunified SaaS solution.  \\n  \\nDigital  & app innovation  \\nFrom GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive developer tools. GitHub Copilot had a breakout year, as it \\nbecame standard issue for developers in every industry. We now have more than 1.8  million paid subscribers and over \\n77,000 enterprise cu stomers, up 180  percent year -over-year. They are realizing productivity gains of up to 55  percent while'),\n",

This year, we also introduced Copilot Workspace, a Copilot -native \\ndeveloper environment, which helps any developer go from idea, to code, to software —all in natural language.  \\nWe are also integrating generative AI across Power Platform, enabling anyone to use natural language to create apps, \\nautomate workflows, or build a website. In total, we now have 48  million monthly active users of Power Platform, up \\n40 percent year -over-year.  \\nModern work  \\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot is becoming a daily habit for knowledge workers, transforming their work, workflow, and work artifacts.  \\nAdoption has been faster than any other new Microsoft 365 suite. And employees at nearly 60  percent of the Fortune 500 \\nnow use Cop ilot to complete tasks faster, hold more effective meetings, and automate business workflows and processes. \\nIn fact, internal and external studies show as much as a 70  percent improvement in productivity using generative AI for \\nspecific work tasks. And ear ly Microsoft 365 Copilot users were 29  percent faster in a series of general tasks like searching, \\nwriting, and summarizing.  \\nAnd we’re going further, bringing the Web plus Work plus Pages together as the new AI design system for knowledge work. \\nWith Pages, which we just announced last month, you can take any information from the web or your work and turn it into \\na multiplayer, A I-powered canvas. You can ideate with AI and then easily share what you create for collaboration with other \\npeople.  \\nAnd with Copilot Studio, customers can extend Copilot with agents and build their own agents that proactively respond to \\ndata and events from their own first - and third -party business data. To date, 50,000 organizations have used it. And, just \\nthis week, w e announced new capabilities that will make it possible for customers to build autonomous agents using Copilot \\nStudio.  \\nMicrosoft Teams remains essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate, and do business. \\nThis year, we rolled out to all customers a new version that is up to two times faster while using 50  percent less memory. \\nAnd Teams Pre mium surpassed 3  million seats, up nearly 400  percent year -over-year, as organizations chose it for \\nadvanced features like end -to-end encryption and real -time translation.  \\nBusiness applications  \\nWe’re using this AI moment to redefine our role in business applications, too. Dynamics 365 once again took share, as \\norganizations use our AI -powered apps to transform their marketing, sales, service, finance, and supply chain functions.  \\nAnd we are expanding our total addressable market by integrating Copilot into third -party systems as well. Our new \\nDynamics 365 Contact Center infuses generative AI throughout the contact center workflow in a customer’s existing CRM.  \\nWe are also extending Copilot to specific industries, including healthcare. With DAX Copilot, more than 400 healthcare \\norganizations are increasing physician productivity and reducing burnout. On average, clinicians save more than five \\nminutes per patient encounter. And 77  percent say it also improves documentation quality.  \\n  \\nSecurity  \\nAs I mentioned earlier, security underpins every layer of our tech stack. We are doubling down on our Secure Future \\nInitiative, as we implement our principles of secure by design, secure by default, and secure operations. And we are focused \\non making conti nuous progress across the six pillars of the initiative: protect tenants and isolate production systems; protect \\nidentities and secrets; protect networks; protect engineering systems; monitor and detect threats; and accelerate response \\nand remediation. As part of this commitment, all Microsoft employees now have security as a “core priority,” holding each \\none of us accountable for building secure products and services.  \\nWe are continuously applying what we are learning and translating it into security innovation for our customers. A great \\nexample is Copilot for Security, which we made generally available this year. It brings together LLMs with domain -specific'),\n",

Copilot+ PCs are the fastest, most AI -ready Windows PCs ever built. They include a new system \\narchitecture designe d to deliver best -in-class performance and breakthrough AI experiences. And we are working across \\nour entire ecosystem to bring these to life, including with AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, along with our OEM partners.  \\nProfessional social network  \\nLinkedIn continues to see accelerated member growth and record engagement. We surpassed 1  billion members for the \\nfirst time this year, as we combine our unique data with this new generation of AI to transform how people learn, sell, and \\nget hired. LinkedI n Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the \\nright message, to the right audience, on a safe and trusted platform. And when it comes to our subscription businesses, \\nPremium signups increased 51  percent, and we are adding even more value to our members and customers with new AI \\ntools and skilling opportunities.  \\nSearch, ads, and news  \\nWith Copilot, we’re taking the first steps toward creating an AI companion, one that’s always by your side, helping you feel \\nsmarter and more supported through natural conversations. The refreshed Copilot app we introduced earlier this month \\ndelivers a mor e intuitive design with more digestible, speedy, and fluent answers. It now adapts to you with a warm tone \\nand a distinct style, providing not only information but encouragement, feedback, and advice as you navigate life’s everyday \\nchallenges —no matter how  big or small. And we’re adding advanced capabilities like Voice and Vision that make it both \\nmore useful and more natural.  \\nWe also continue to apply generative AI to pioneer new approaches to how people search and browse. Microsoft Bing and \\nEdge both took share again this year. And we introduced Copilot Pro, providing access to the latest models for quick answers \\nand higher -quality image creation, and access to Copilot for Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers.  \\nThousands of news and entertainment publishers trust us to reach new audiences with Microsoft Start. And we are also \\nhelping advertisers increase their ROI. Copilot in Microsoft Ad Platform helps marketers create campaigns and troubleshoot \\nusing natural la nguage.  \\n  \\nGaming  \\nWe are bringing great games to more people on more devices. With our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, which closed \\nOctober 2023, we’ve added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem. We now have 20 franchises that have \\ngenerated over $1  billion in lifetime revenue —from Candy Crush , Diablo , and Halo, to Warcraft , Elder Scrolls , and Gears of \\nWar. And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love —\\nwhere, when, and how they want. Finally, we brought four of our fan -favorite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation \\nfor the first tim e, as we continue to extend our content to new platforms.  \\nOUR MISSION  \\nAlthough we have made outstanding progress over the past year, we cannot take our permission to innovate —let alone \\noperate —for granted. It is something we must earn.  \\nWe always say Microsoft will do well only if the world around us does well. And that’s why we are focused on four enduring \\ncommitments. They keep us grounded, serving as a guide as we make decisions, pushing us to ask critical questions to \\nensure the techn ology we create benefits everyone on the planet, as well as the planet itself.'),\n",

Toge ther with our partners, we also made significant strides in skilling. We have trained and certified 14.1  million \\npeople across 202 countries in digital skills as of June 2024. Over 80  percent of the learners were from groups furthest from \\nopportunity in th e digital economy.  \\nAnd our work doesn’t stop there. We must do more to accelerate the equitable adoption of AI and narrow the digital divide. \\nThat’s why we’ve launched new AI skilling initiatives in partnership with governments, educational institutions, industry, an d \\ncivil society —to help millions of people learn to use generative AI, develop AI tools, and lead AI adoption. This includes \\npeople from underserved communities, with a focus on young people, women, rural communities, and the Global South, as \\nwell as employees of social impact organizations.  \\nHow can we earn trust?  \\nWe recognize that trust is earned, not given. And we remain committed to earning trust every day, spanning cybersecurity, \\ntrustworthy AI, privacy, and digital safety.  \\nOur Secure Future Initiative advances how we design, build, test, and operate our technology to ensure we deliver solutions \\nthat meet the highest possible standard of security. Our first  SFI Progress Report highlights updates spanning culture, \\ngovernance, technology, and operations, but we recognize that our work on security is never complete. We must and will \\ndo more. Our promise is to continually learn, improve, and adapt to the evolving needs of an increasingly complex security \\nlandscape.  \\nWe are focused on building AI that is trustworthy, meaning that it is secure, safe, and private. Our responsible AI practices , \\ngrounded in our foundational AI principles, help ensure we do this from the beginning. And  we’re building on this \\ncommitment by i ntroducing new product capabilities across our tech stack, ensuring that both our customers and developers \\nare safeguarded at every level.  Ultimately, these commitments and capabilities are key to fulfilling our mission. The world \\nis looking to us to help defend and protect them, and we take that responsibility seriously.  \\n  \\nIn May, we published our first AI Transparency Report, which outlines how we build generative applications responsibly and \\nsupport our customers. We also released Goals and Governance: Goals and Lessons for AI, which draws lessons from \\nother globally gover ned technologies like civil aviation and nuclear power. Through our Accelerating Foundation Models \\nResearch program, we’ve made grants to hundreds of projects in AI safety and alignment research, AI -driven scientific \\ndiscovery, and beneficial applications of AI. And we launched our Global Perspectives Responsible AI Fellowship program, \\ndesigned to center the voices of AI experts from the Global South and enable us to better understand AI’s impact on \\ndeveloping countries.  \\nAs we drive AI innovation, we continue to respond to a changing privacy landscape. We provide tools to help our customers \\nprotect their privacy and control their data, and we have published several resources outlining our approach to privacy and \\nAI for our  consumer, commercial, and public sector customers.  \\nFinally, we continue our work to create safe experiences online and protect customers from illegal and harmful content and \\nconduct. To bolster our efforts to prevent child sexual exploitation and abuse risks, we have made new commitments to \\nsafety by desig n in our AI services, joined the Tech Coalition’s Lantern Program, and proposed concrete actions that US \\npolicymakers can take to protect the public through regulatory and policy measures.  \\nHow can we protect fundamental rights?  \\nWe are committed to protecting fundamental rights —extending the benefits of technology while mitigating its potential \\nharms. For us, this means promoting responsible business practices, expanding connectivity and accessibility, protecting \\ndemocracy, and ad vancing a fair and inclusive society.'),\n",

Going forward, \\nwe’ll continue t o respect global human rights and laws and take steps to mitigate the impact of our operations and our \\ntechnology on the people in our value chain.  \\nAs we build and deploy more AI solutions, connectivity and accessibility are foundational. Since 2017, we’ve extended \\naccess to affordable high -speed internet to over 100  million people, including nearly 40  million in Africa. And we remain \\nfocused on build ing inclusive, accessible AI that empowers people across the spectrum of disability.  \\nMore than 4  billion people will vote this year in their respective elections, making it the biggest election year in history. At \\nthe Munich Security Conference in February, we came together with others across the tech sector and pledged to help \\nprevent dec eptive AI content from interfering with global elections. As part of this pledge, we have worked to empower \\ncampaigns, candidates, election officials, and voters to understand the risks of deceptive AI in elections and to take steps \\nto protect themselves a nd democracies. To date, we’ve conducted deepfake trainings in over 20 countries. And our \\ncorresponding public awareness campaign has reached over 355  million people.  \\nLastly, we continued investing in both strategic national partnerships and community -based projects that leverage data and \\ninsights to enable changes that advance racial equity and fairness in the criminal legal system.  \\nHow can we advance sustainability?  \\nFinally, we are on a journey to build a more sustainable future, from addressing our own environmental footprint to \\nempowering our customers and the world with the technology needed to meet the climate challenge. Over the past year, \\nwe have seen how AI can  catalyze environmental progress in remarkable ways —from increasing the capacity of \\ntransmission lines to deliver renewable power, to the discovery of new materials to support energy production and storage, \\nto empowering the workforce with sustainability s kills.  \\nBut we also recognize the resource intensity of the infrastructure needed to yield these benefits, which is why we’re \\nadvancing the sustainability of AI, from design to construction to operations, all while working to improve the efficiency of  \\nthese techno logies. We’re also investing in innovation through Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund and our AI for Good \\nLab, advancing research and advocating for policies that can drive global impact.  \\n  \\nIn our latest Environmental Sustainability Report, we shared progress toward our 2030 commitments. We’re on track in \\nseveral areas. Where we’re not yet on track, we’re mobilizing to accelerate our progress toward becoming carbon negative, \\nwater positive, a nd zero waste, as well as to protect and preserve ecosystems.  \\nWhen it comes to our carbon footprint, we continue to support clean electricity infrastructure through long -term investments \\nto bring more power onto the grids where we operate. Since setting our carbon negative target, we have contracted over \\n34 gigawatts  of renewable energy, including projects in 24 countries.  \\nIn our efforts to become water positive, we provided more than 1.5  million people with access to clean water and sanitation, \\nachieving our water access target.  \\nOur journey to zero waste includes reducing waste at our campuses and datacenters and advancing circularity for cloud \\nhardware, packaging, and devices. Our most recent report showed we had a reuse and recycle rate of 89.4  percent for \\nservers and components  across all cloud hardware.  \\nFinally, AI gives new opportunity for ecosystem and biodiversity management with solutions like AI -assisted bioacoustics. \\nAnd we’re expanding collaboration with local communities to build and operate datacenters in ways that address local \\nchallenges and cr eate greater benefits.

This engineering group includes \\nMicrosoft Research, one of the world’s largest corporate research  organizations, which focuses on fundamental \\nresearch in AI, computer science, and a broad range of other disciplines.  \\n• LinkedIn  – focuses on our services that transform the way professionals grow their network and find jobs and \\nthe way businesses hire, market, sell, and learn.  \\n• Gaming  – focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help \\ngrow our user base through game experiences and social interaction.  \\nInternal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer \\ntechnical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and \\nenhancements are most impor tant and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as \\npossible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design. Before \\nreleasing new software platforms, and as we make signifi cant modifications to existing platforms, we provide application \\nvendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing.

For a discussion of the year ended June  30, 2023 \\ncompared to the year ended June  30, 2022, please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition \\nand Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form  10-K for the  year ended June  30, 2023.  \\nOVERVIEW  \\nMicrosoft is a technology company committed to making digital technology and artificial intelligence (“AI”) available broadly  \\nand doing so responsibly, with a mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. \\nWe create p latforms and tools, powered by AI, that deliver innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of our \\ncustomers.  \\nWe generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud -based solutions, content, and other services to people and \\nbusinesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global \\naudience; and designing and selling devices. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; \\nsupporting and investing in our cloud -based services, including datacenter operations; designing, manufacturing, marketing, \\nand selling our other products and service s; and income taxes.  \\nHighlights from fiscal year 2024 compared with fiscal year 2023 included:  \\n• Microsoft Cloud revenue increased 23% to $137.4  billion.  \\n• Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 14% driven by Office 365 Commercial \\ngrowth of 16%.  \\n• Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 4% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers \\ngrew to 82.5  million.  \\n• LinkedIn revenue increased 9%.  \\n• Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 19% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 24%.  \\n• Server products and cloud services revenue increased 22% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth \\nof 30%.  \\n• Windows revenue increased 8% with Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (“Windows OEM”) \\nrevenue growth of 7% and Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue growth of 11%.  \\n• Devices revenue decreased 15%.  \\n• Xbox content and services revenue increased 50% driven by 44 points of net impact from the Activision Blizzard \\nInc. (“Activision Blizzard”) acquisition. The net impact reflects the change of Activision Blizzard content from \\nthird-party to first -party.  \\n• Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 12%.  \\nOn October  13, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard for a total purchase price of $75.4  billion, \\nconsisting primarily of cash. The financial results of Activision Blizzard have been included in our consolidated financial \\nstatements sin ce the date of the acquisition.

Each \\nindustry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the \\nindustry and our b usiness. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and \\ndevelopment activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, \\nand competitive forces.  \\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks  \\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud -based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are \\ndeveloping new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud -based services for consumers and businesses. \\nThe devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in \\nsome cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud -based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, \\nand devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue \\nto evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment.  \\nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and \\nmay decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations \\nand increas e our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for \\nAI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking \\nsupplies, and servers, incl uding graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. Our devices are primarily \\nmanufactured by third -party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other \\nmanufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavai lable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products \\ncontain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could \\nimpact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet con sumer demand.  \\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and \\nindustry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, \\nbroad customer  reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, \\nand competitive compensation and benefits.  \\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and \\nexpenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may \\nsignificantly affe ct revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not have \\na material impact on reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2024.  \\nRefer to Risk Factors in our fiscal year 2024 Form 10 -K for a discussion of these factors and other risks.  \\nSeasonality  \\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Fourth quarter revenue is \\ndriven by a higher volume of multi -year contracts executed during the period.   \\nChange in Accounting Estimate  \\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in \\nsoftware that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in \\ntechnology, we determine d we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four \\nyears to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.'),\n",

Equity and other investments were $14.6  billion and $9.9  billion as of June  30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \\nOur short -term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly \\nof highly liquid investment -grade fixed -income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The \\ninvestments are predomin antly U.S. dollar -denominated securities, but also include foreign currency -denominated securities \\nto diversify risk. Our fixed -income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average \\nmaturity of our fixed -income p ortfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed -income \\nindices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short -term investments held are \\nprimarily highly liquid investment -grade fixed -income securities.  \\nValuation  \\nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the  \\nfair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level  1 investments, such as U.S. government \\nsecu rities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities \\nare not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the \\nquoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level  2 investments, \\nsuch as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage - and asset -\\nbacked secu rities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level  3 investments are valued using internally -\\ndeveloped models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using \\nunobservable inputs are an imma terial portion of our portfolio.  \\nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level  1 or Level  2 investments as these \\nvendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying \\nsignificant a djustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by \\nour pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. \\nOur broker -priced in vestments are generally classified as Level  2 investments because the broker prices these investments \\nbased on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker -priced investments have a \\nsufficient level of trading volume  to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair \\nvalue processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include \\nmodel validation, review of key model inputs , analysis of period -over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of \\nprices where appropriate.  \\nCash Flows  \\nCash from operations increased $31.0  billion to $118.5  billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to an increase in cash \\nreceived from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $6.2  billion to $37.8  billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due \\nto a $5.0  billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $3.3  billion increase in proceeds from issuance of debt, net \\nof repayments, offset in part by a $2.0  billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing increased $74.3  billion to \\n$97.0  billion for fiscal year 2024, primarily due to a $67.5  billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of \\ncash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets and a $16.4  billion increase in additions to property and \\nequipment.  \\nDebt Proceeds  \\nWe issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating. The \\nproceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, \\nfunding for wo rking capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. \\nRefer to Note 11 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion.  \\nUnearned Revenue  \\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software \\nAssurance (“SA”) and cloud services.

We have not engaged \\nin any related party transactions or arrang ements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to \\nmaterially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.  \\nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  \\nRefer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion.  \\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  \\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing \\nconsolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported \\namounts of assets, liabilities, re venue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a \\nsignificant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operati ons. \\nWe have critical accounting estimates in  the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, \\nresearch and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and business combinations – valuation of \\nintangible assets.  \\nRevenue Recognition  \\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining \\nwhether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately \\nversus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud -based service includes both on -premises software licenses \\nand cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted \\nfor separately, or not distinct  and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud \\nservices, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the \\ndesktop applications and cloud services,  and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from \\nOffice 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  \\nJudgment is required to determine the standalone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation. We use a \\nsingle amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on -premises licenses sold with SA or software \\nupdates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products \\nand services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the \\nvarious products and se rvices.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'F:\\\\Multi-User Document Search and Conversational Q&A System\\\\data\\\\Microsoft\\\\2024_Annual_Report.pdf'}, page_content='39 In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we \\ndetermine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have \\nmore than one SSP for  individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers \\nand circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in \\ndetermining the SSP.  \\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, \\nincluding the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.  \\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances \\nwe estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when \\ndetermining the amo unt of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at \\nthe end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable \\nconsideration were not material for the peri ods presented.  \\n  \\nImpairment of Investment Securities  \\nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, \\nwe evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to \\nwhich the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ \\na systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment \\nof our investments . In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business \\noutlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to se ll the \\nsecurity before reco very, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income \\n(expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions \\ndeteriorate, we may incur future impairm ents.  \\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment \\nindicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a \\nqualitative asse ssment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the \\namount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other \\nincome (expense), net.  \\nGoodwill  \\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We \\nevaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation \\napproach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating \\nsegment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would \\nmore likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could \\ninclude a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale o r \\ndisposition of a significant por tion of a reporting unit.  \\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of  \\nassets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each \\nreporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow \\nmethodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on \\ninternal fore casts, estimation of the long -term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash \\nflows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.  \\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, \\nmarket conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination \\nof fair value  and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.'),\n",

Once technological feasibility is established, software costs  \\nare capitalized u ntil the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when \\ntechnological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software \\nproducts is reached after all  high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this \\noccurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue  \\nover the estimated life of the produc ts.  \\n  \\nLegal and Other Contingencies    \\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss \\nfrom a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset \\nhas been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining \\nwhether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome \\nand the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our \\nconsolidated financial statements.  \\nIncome Taxes  \\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current \\nyear, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an \\nentity’s financ ial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely \\nthan not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of t he \\nposition. T he tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest \\nbenefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provide s \\nguidance on derecog nition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, \\naccounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in \\nassessing the future tax con sequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax \\nreturns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial  \\nstatements.  \\nBusiness Combinations – Valuation of Intangible Assets  \\nAccounting for business combinations requires significant judgments when allocating the purchase price to the estimated \\nfair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Determination of fair value involves estimate s \\nand assum ptions which can be complex, most notably with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates used in the \\nvaluation of intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected cash flows, useful lives, and \\ndiscount rates. Whi le management’s estimates of fair value are based on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, \\nthese assumptions are inherently uncertain as they pertain to forward -looking views of our business and market conditions. \\nThe judgments made in this valua tion process could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.'),\n",

The recast of these prior period \\namounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows \\nstatements.  \\nPrinciples of Consolidation  \\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany \\ntransactions and balances have been eliminated.  \\nEstimates and Assumptions  \\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts \\nof assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, \\ndetermining the nat ure and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price \\n(“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss \\ncontingencies; product warra nties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our \\nreporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; t he \\nmarket value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock -based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility \\nis achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated \\nfinancial statements or tax returns; and d etermining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results \\nand outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.  \\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in \\nsoftware that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in \\ntechnology, we determine d we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four \\nyears to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023.  \\nForeign Currencies  \\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue \\nand expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting \\nfrom this pr ocess are recorded to other comprehensive income.  \\nRevenue  \\nProduct Revenue and Service and Other Revenue  \\nProduct revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross -device productivity and collaboration applications, server \\napplications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video \\ngames, and hardware  such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related \\naccessories.  \\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud -based solutions that provide customers with software, services, \\nplatforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and gaming; solution support; and consulting services. \\nService and other rev enue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'F:\\\\Multi-User Document Search and Conversational Q&A System\\\\data\\\\Microsoft\\\\2024_Annual_Report.pdf'}, page_content='49 Revenue Recognition  \\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects \\nthe consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include \\nvarious comb inations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate \\nperformance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, \\nwhich are subsequently remit ted to governmental authorities.  \\nNature of Products and Services  \\nLicenses for on -premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available \\nto the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the \\nsame functionalit y and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from \\ndistinct on -premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. \\nIn cases where we allocate re venue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional \\ncharge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related \\ndevice or license.  \\nCertain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on -premises licenses combined with Software \\nAssurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, \\ntools, and trai ning to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On -premises licenses are considered distinct \\nperformance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract \\nperiod as customers simultane ously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance \\nobligations that are satisfied over time.  \\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the \\nsoftware, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a \\nsubscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a \\nconsumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such \\nresources. When cloud services requir e a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the \\nindividual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are \\nprovided.  \\nRevenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action \\nnecessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are \\nprovided.  \\nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function \\nwithout the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance \\nobligation a nd revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end \\ncustomers through retail stores and online marketplaces.  \\nRefer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant \\nproduct and service offering.  \\nSignificant Judgments  \\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining \\nwhether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately \\nversus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud -based service includes both on -premises software licenses \\nand cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted \\nfor separately, or not distinct  and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud \\nservices, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the \\ndesktop applications and cloud services,  and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from \\nOffice 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.  \\n  \\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate \\nSSP for items that are not sold separately, including on -premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'F:\\\\Multi-User Document Search and Conversational Q&A System\\\\data\\\\Microsoft\\\\2024_Annual_Report.pdf'}, page_content='50 additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately \\nand need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and \\nservices.  \\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we \\ndetermine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have \\nmore than one SSP for  individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers \\nand circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in \\ndetermining the SSP.  \\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, \\nincluding the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.  \\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances \\nwe estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when \\ndetermining the amo unt of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at \\nthe end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable \\nconsideration were not material for the peri ods presented.  \\nContract Balances and Other Receivables  \\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue \\nis recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi -year \\nagreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a \\nreceivable related to revenue recognized for multi -year on -premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice \\nand receive payment in the future re lated to those licenses.  \\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and \\ncloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi -year \\nagreements and recogni zed ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting \\nservices to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post -\\ndelivery support, Dynamics business solu tions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the \\nrevenue when we transfer control of the product or service.  \\nRefer to Note 13 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in \\nunearned revenue during the period.  \\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 \\nto 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined \\nour contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to \\nprovide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing \\nfrom our customers or to p rovide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription \\nterm with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi -year on -premises licenses that are invoiced \\nannually with revenue recognized upfront.  \\nAs of June  30, 2024 and 2023, long -term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.9  billion and \\n$4.5 billion, respectively, and is included in other long -term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.  \\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable \\nbalance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently \\navailable evidence.'),\n",

As of June  30, 2024 and 2023, our financing \\nreceivables, net we re $4.5  billion and $5.3  billion, respectively, for short -term and long -term financing receivables, which \\nare included in other current assets and other long -term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be \\ncapitalized. To tal capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in \\nother current and long -term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.  \\nWe apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the \\namortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales organization compensation \\nprogram and certain p artner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with \\nannual sales activities.  \\nCost of Revenue  \\nCost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs \\nrelated to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold \\nby original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs \\nincurred to support and maintain cloud -based and other online products and services, including datacenter costs and \\nroyalties; warranty costs;  inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the \\namortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the \\nestimated lives of the products.  \\n  \\nProduct Warranty  \\nWe provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the relat ed \\nrevenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure \\nrates, h istorical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware \\nwarranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally'),\n",

For software warranties, we estimate \\nthe costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate ou r \\nestimat es to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.  \\nResearch and Development  \\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock -based compensation expense, and other \\nheadcount -related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third -\\nparty development and pro gramming costs and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such \\ncosts related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological \\nfeasibility is reached, which for our softwa re products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. \\nOnce technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated \\nlives of the products.  \\nSales and Marketing  \\nSales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock -based compensation expense, and other \\nheadcount -related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade \\nshows, seminars, and othe r programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.7  billion, \\n$904  million, and $1.5  billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.  \\nStock -Based Compensation  \\nCompensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”), \\nis measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related \\nservice or per formance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the \\ngrant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value \\nof PSUs using a Monte Carlo va luation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight -line method \\nand for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method.  \\nCompensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is \\nentitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.  \\nIncome Taxes  \\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. \\nCertain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of \\nsuch temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation \\nallowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified a s \\nlong-term in our consolidat ed balance sheets.  \\nFinancial Instruments  \\nInvestments  \\nWe consider all highly liquid interest -earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to \\nbe cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with \\noriginal  maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short -term \\ninvestments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short -term based on their highly liquid nature \\nand because su ch marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.  \\nDebt investments are classified as available -for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific \\nidentification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive \\nincome. Fair valu e is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by \\nmanagement. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market \\nconditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine'),\n",

In \\naddition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee.  If \\nwe have pl ans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, \\nthen a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost \\nbasis in the inv estment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future \\nimpairments.  \\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily \\ndeterminable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable \\nchanges in price or im pairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a \\nperiodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less t han \\ncarrying value. Changes in val ue are recorded in other income (expense), net.  \\nInvestments that are considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”) are evaluated to determine whether we are the primary \\nbeneficiary of the VIE, in which case we would be required to consolidate the entity. We evaluate whether we have (1)  the \\npower to dir ect the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, and (2)  the obligation to absorb \\nlosses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We have determined we \\nare not the prim ary beneficiary of any of our VIE investments. Therefore, our VIE investments are not consolidated and the \\nmajority are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  \\nDerivatives  \\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes \\nin the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.  \\nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), \\nnet with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from \\nthe assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.  \\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other \\ncomprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. \\nGains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other \\nincome (expense), net.  \\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily \\nrecognized in other income (expense), net.  \\nFair Value Measurements  \\nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on th e \\nextent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.  We categorize each of our fair value \\nmeasuremen ts in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement \\nin its entirety. These levels are:  \\n• Level  1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our \\nLevel  1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds.  Our \\nLevel  1 derivative assets and liabilities include thos e actively traded on exchanges.   \\n  \\n• Level  2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for \\nidentical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model -based valuation techniques (e.g. the \\nBlack -Scholes model) for which all significa nt inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by \\nobservable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models \\nproject future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a pre sent value using market -based observable \\ninputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for \\ncurrencies. Our Level  2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency secur ities, \\nforeign government bonds, mortgage - and asset -backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal \\nsecurities. Our Level  2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over -the-\\ncounter forward, option, and swap  contracts.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'F:\\\\Multi-User Document Search and Conversational Q&A System\\\\data\\\\Microsoft\\\\2024_Annual_Report.pdf'}, page_content='54 • Level  3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that \\nmarket participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using \\nmodel -based techniques, including option p ricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level  3 assets \\nand liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and \\nintangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge.  Unobservable inputs used \\nin the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.  \\nWe measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these \\ninvestments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted \\nmarket prices, ma rket comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.  \\nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.   \\nInventories  \\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor,  \\nand manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated \\nselling pr ice less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on \\nhand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a \\nreduction in utili ty below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.  \\nProperty and Equipment  \\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight -line method \\nover the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and \\nequipment ar e generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three years; computer \\nequipment, two to six years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and \\nfurniture and equipment, one t o 10 years. Land is not depreciated.  \\nLeases  \\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right -of-use \\n(“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases  \\nare included  in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long -term liabilities in our consolidated balance \\nsheets.  \\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation \\nto make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at \\ncommencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not \\nprovide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for \\ncollateralized borrowing over a similar term of t he lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset \\nalso includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or \\nterminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exerc ise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is \\nrecognized on a straight -line basis over the lease term.  \\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non -lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain \\nequipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non -lease components as a single lease component. \\nAdditionally, for cer tain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU \\nassets and liabilities.  \\nGoodwill  \\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) \\non an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely \\nthan not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.'),\n",

We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events \\nor circumstan ces that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.  \\nRelated Party Transactions  \\nIn March 2024, we entered into an agreement with Inflection AI, Inc. (“Inflection”), pursuant to which we obtained a non -\\nexclusive license to Inflection’s intellectual property. Reid Hoffman, a member of our Board of Directors, is a co -founder of \\nand serve s on the board of directors of Inflection. As of the date of the agreement with Inflection, Reprogrammed \\nInterchange LLC (“Reprogrammed”) and entities affiliated with Greylock Ventures (“Greylock”) each held less than a 10% \\nequity interest in Inflection. M r. Hoffman may be deemed to beneficially own the shares held by Reprogrammed and \\nGreylock by virtue of his relationship with such entities. Mr.  Hoffman did not participate in any portions of the meetings of \\nour Board of Directors or any committee thereof t o review and approve the transaction with Inflection.  \\nRecent Accounting Guidance  \\nSegment Reporting – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures  \\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new standard to improve reportable \\nsegment disclosures. The guidance expands the disclosures required for reportable segments in our annual and interim \\nconsolidated financial stat ements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The \\nstandard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal year 2025 and interim periods thereafter, wi th \\nearly adoption permitted.

The guidance requires disclosure \\nof disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standardized categories for the components of the effective tax rate \\nreconciliation, and mod ifies other income tax -related disclosures. The standard will be effective for us beginning with our \\nannual reporting for fiscal year 2026, with early adoption permitted.

We assumed responsibility \\nfor these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the \\nNokia defendants. Twelve of thes e cases were consolidated for certain pre -trial proceedings; the remaining cases are \\nstayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims  \\narising from the use of cellular handsets tha t operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency \\nemission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre -empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either \\noperated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured befo re the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also \\nallege an industry -wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.  \\nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on \\nthe basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ mot ion \\nto exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia \\nCourt of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals \\nissued its  decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further \\nproceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by \\nthe court. A hear ing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants’ \\nmotion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs’ experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of \\nplaintiffs’ experts fr om testifying. The parties agreed to a stipulated dismissal of the  consolidated cases to allow plaintiffs to \\nappeal the expert testimony order. Plaintiffs appealed the court’s order in August of 2023, and the parties have filed their \\nbriefs on the appeal. A hearing on the status of the stayed cases occurred in December of 2023. In July 2024, the court \\nentered summary judgment in nine of the stayed cases on the grounds that plaintiffs had agreed to be bound by the general \\ncausation outcome in the consolidate d cases.  \\nIrish Data Protection Commission Matter  \\nIn 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (“IDPC”) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether \\nLinkedIn’s targeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection \\nRegulation (“GDPR”). Mi crosoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with \\na non -public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR violations and proposing a fine. In July 2024, the IDPC provided \\nLinkedIn with a revised non -public dr aft decision. There is no set timeline for the IDPC to issue a final decision, at which \\ntime Microsoft will consider its options to appeal.  \\nOther Contingencies  \\nWe also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our busines s. \\nAlthough management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a \\nmaterial adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and \\nmanagement’s view of these matters may change in the future.  \\nAs of June  30, 2024, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $641  million. While we intend to defend these matters \\nvigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $600  million in aggregate beyond recorded \\namounts are reasonably po ssible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material \\nadverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.'),\n",

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB \\nand are required  to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and \\nthe applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  \\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform \\nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether \\ndue to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial \\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included \\nexamining, on a tes t basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for \\ntax years  subsequent to 2003.

The Company accounted for the \\nActivision Blizzard, Inc., acquisition as a business combination and, accordingly, allocated the purchase price to the assets  \\nacquired and  liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Identifiable \\nintangible assets acquired included marketing -related intangible assets, technology -based intangible assets, and customer -\\nrelated intangible as sets. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and \\nliabilities assumed was recorded as goodwill.  \\nWe identified the fair value determination of certain marketing -related and technology -based intangible assets for the \\nbusiness combination as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgment required in determining their estimated fair \\nvalues. Mana gement’s estimates of fair value included assumptions for revenue and expense forecasts and the selection \\nof appropriate discount rates. There was a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in applying audit procedures \\nand evaluating the significan t assumptions relating to the estimates, including involvement of our fair value specialists.  \\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit  \\nOur audit procedures related to management’s estimates of the fair value of certain marketing -related and technology -\\nbased intangible assets acquired included the following, among others:  \\n• We tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the business combination, including internal controls \\nover the revenue and expense forecasts and the selection of appropriate discount rates.  \\n• We assessed the knowledge, skills, abilities, and objectivity of management’s valuation specialist and evaluated the \\nwork performed.  \\n  \\n• When assessing the reasonableness of assumptions related to forecasted revenue and expenses, we evaluated \\nwhether the assumptions used were reasonable considering historical financial information of Activision Blizzard, Inc., \\nand the Company’s forecasted f inancial information.  \\n• With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rates by:  \\n- Testing the source information underlying the discount rates and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.'),\n",

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures \\nthat (1)  pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \\ndispositi ons of the assets of the company; (2)  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary \\nto permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts \\nand expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of \\nthe company; and (3)  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, \\nuse, or disposition of the company’s as sets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.'),\n",

Business\\nABOUT US\\nNetflix, Inc. (“Netflix”, “the Company”, “registrant”, “we”, or “us”) is one of the world’s leading entertainment services with approximately 302 million\\npaid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can play, pause and\\nresume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\\nOur core strategy is to grow our business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We strive to continuously improve our members\\'\\nexperience by offering compelling content that delights them and attracts new members. We aim to offer a range of pricing plans, including our ad-supported\\nsubscription plan, to meet a variety of consumer needs. We seek to drive conversation around our content to further enhance member joy, and we are\\ncontinuously enhancing our user interface to help our members more easily choose content that they will find enjoyable.\\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our\\nmembers. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information, in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\\nCOMPETITION\\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete with a broad set of activities for consumers’ leisure\\ntime, including other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content),\\nvideo gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, some of which are by professional content creators, and more broadly against other sources of\\nentertainment, such as social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against entertainment video providers and\\ncontent producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of\\nfree time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of truth.\" In attempting to win these moments of truth with our members,\\nwe seek to continually improve our service, including both our technology and our content offerings.\\nSEASONALITY\\nOur membership growth exhibits a seasonal pattern that reflects variations when consumers buy internet-connected screens and when they tend to\\nincrease their viewing. Historically, the fourth quarter represents our greatest streaming membership growth. In addition, our membership growth can be\\nimpacted by our content release schedule and changes to pricing and plans.\\n1'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'F:\\\\Multi-User Document Search and Conversational Q&A System\\\\data\\\\Netflix\\\\Netflix-10-K-01272025.pdf'}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies and similar intellectual\\nproperty as important to our success. We use a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our\\nproprietary intellectual property. Our intellectual property rights extend to our technology, business processes, the content we produce and distribute through\\nour service, and the consumer products and experiences based thereon. We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content,\\nmerchandising our products and marketing our service. Our ability to provide our members with content they can watch depends on studios, content providers\\nand other rights holders licensing rights, including distribution rights, to such content and certain related elements thereof, such as the public performance of\\nmusic contained within the content we distribute. The license periods and the terms and conditions of such licenses vary. Our ability to protect and enforce our\\nintellectual property rights is subject to certain risks and from time to time we encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property.\\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will prevail in any intellectual property disputes.\\nREGULATION\\nThe media landscape and the internet delivery of content have seen growing regulatory action. Historically, media has been highly regulated in many\\ncountries. We are seeing some of these legacy regulatory frameworks be updated and expanded to address services like ours. In particular, we are seeing some\\ncountries update their cultural support legislation to include services like Netflix. This includes content quotas, levies and investment obligations. Some even\\nrestrict the extent of ownership rights we can have both in our service and in our content. In certain countries, regulators are also looking at restrictions that\\ncould require formal reviews of and/or adjustments to content that appears on our service in their country. In general these regulations impact all services and\\nmay make operating in certain jurisdictions more expensive or restrictive as to the content offerings we may provide.\\nHUMAN CAPITAL\\nWe view our employees and our culture as key to our success. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 14,000 full-time employees. Of these,\\napproximately 9,600 (69%) were located in the United States and Canada, 2,200 (16%) in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, 600 (4%) in Latin America and\\n1,600 (11%) in Asia-Pacific. We also have a number of employees engaged in content production, some of whom are part-time or temporary, and whose\\nnumbers fluctuate throughout the year and may be covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe an important component of our success is our\\ncompany culture. This culture, which is detailed in a \"Culture Memo\" located on our website, is often described as providing a unique environment for our\\nemployees to perform the best work of their lives in pursuit of excellence. We aim to attract and retain great people - representing a diverse array of\\nperspectives and skills - to work together as a dream team. As our business grows and changes, we seek to improve our culture to meet the new needs of our\\nbusiness. We believe our dynamic culture helps us create a better experience for our members, employees, creators and partners.\\nAs we have expanded our offices globally, our company culture remains an important aspect of our operations. We are mindful of cultural differences\\nacross and within regions. Fostering a work environment that is culturally diverse, inclusive and equitable is a major focus for us. We work to build diversity,\\ninclusion and equity into all aspects of our operations globally, with the goal of having diversity and inclusion function as a critical lens through which each\\nNetflix employee carries out their role. We want more people and cultures to see themselves reflected on screen - so it’s important that our employee base is\\ndiverse and represents the communities we serve. We look to help increase representation by educating our people leaders and recruiters on how to hire more\\ninclusively, and to help the company and senior leaders diversify their networks. We also support numerous employee resource groups (ERGs), representing\\nemployees and allies from a broad array of historically underrepresented and/or marginalized communities. We publish annually an update on our inclusion\\ninitiatives and progress, which further highlights our approach to diversity and inclusion, and publish our EEO-1 reports on our website.\\nWe believe in fostering great leaders. We offer various experiences and training to inform our employees about our culture and other context that we\\nbelieve is important for success at Netflix. We aim to equip our people leaders (officers, VPs, directors, and manager-level employees) to lead the business and\\nour teams in alignment with our expectations and strategic objectives.\\nWe aim generally to pay our employees at their personal top of market, and they generally are able to choose the form of their compensation between\\ncash and stock options. This permits employee compensation to be highly personalized and reflective of each employee\\'s individual needs and preferences. We\\nconduct pay equity analyses at least annually, and have adopted practices to help ensure that employees from underrepresented groups are not being underpaid\\nbased on gender identity (globally) and race or ethnicity (U.S.) relative to others doing the same or similar work under comparable circumstances. We aim to\\nrectify any pay gaps that we find through this analysis.\\nWe care about the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide a variety of benefit programs based on region, including health\\nbenefits. In the U.S., employees generally receive an annual cash health benefit allowance that they may allocate to medical, dental and vision premiums in a\\nway that makes sense for them. Employees have access to a host of other benefits, including mental health, childcare, family planning and a company match\\nfor charitable donations.\\nWe believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made Netflix a desirable destination for employees.\\n2'),\n",

Risk Factors\\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of\\nour common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\\nRisks Related to Our Business\\nIf our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\\nWe must continually add new members both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. Our ability\\nto continue to attract and retain members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members in countries around the globe with compelling\\ncontent choices that keep our members engaged with our service, effectively drive conversation around our content and service, as well as provide a quality\\nexperience for choosing and enjoying TV series, films and games. Our penetration and growth rates have fluctuated and vary across the jurisdictions where we\\nprovide our service. In countries where we have been operating for many years or where we are highly penetrated, our membership growth is slower than in\\nnewer or less penetrated countries. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may\\nadversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as linear television, and streaming\\nentertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers, as well as user-generated content, some of which are by\\nprofessional content creators, and more broadly other sources of entertainment, such as social media, that our members could choose in their moments of free\\ntime.\\nMembers cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, that they need to cut household\\nexpenses, dissatisfaction with content, a preference for competitive services and customer service issues that they believe are not satisfactorily resolved.\\nMembership growth is also impacted by seasonality, with the fourth quarter historically representing our greatest growth, as well as the timing of our content\\nrelease schedules. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, may also adversely impact our ability to attract and retain members. If we do not\\ngrow as expected, given, in particular, that our content costs are largely fixed in nature, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per\\nmembership) revenues, including by adjusting membership pricing, commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of\\noperations may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in providing compelling content, retaining\\nour existing members and attracting new members, our business will be adversely affected.\\nIf we do not continuously provide value to our members, including making improvements to our service in a manner that is favorably received by\\nthem, our revenue, results of operations and business will be adversely affected.\\nIf consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service\\nofferings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members, and accordingly,\\nour revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected. We expanded our entertainment video offering to include games and, more recently, live\\nprogramming. If our efforts to sustain and improve our existing TV and film offering, as well as develop and expand our video entertainment options, are not\\ndone in a manner valued by our current and future members, our ability to attract and retain members may be negatively impacted. We may also seek to extend\\nour business into new products and services to help drive growth. For example, we continue to expand our offering of consumer products and live experiences.\\nTo the extent we cannot successfully find and develop new products, experiences and services to help drive growth, or we do not realize the expected benefits\\nor generate additional revenue from such new products, experiences, and services, our future results of operations and growth may be adversely impacted.\\nWe have and may, from time to time, adjust our membership pricing, our membership plans, or our pricing model itself, including for example, the lower-\\npriced ad-supported subscription plan. Similarly, we have increased enforcement of and will continue to enforce our terms of use to limit multi-household\\nusage and shared viewing outside of a household. These and other adjustments we make may not be well-received by consumers, and could negatively impact\\nour ability to attract and retain members, revenue and our results of operations. In addition, many of our members rejoin our service or originate from word-of-\\nmouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members or adjustments to our service are not successful, we may not be able to\\nattract or retain members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected.\\nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video could adversely impact our business.\\nThe market for entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have\\nincreasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and\\npiracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. We face competition from traditional\\nproviders of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers\\nand platforms. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition, exclusive rights to certain content,\\nlarge content libraries, and significant\\n4'),\n",

They may offer more compelling content or secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and\\ndevote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing\\nproviders may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. In addition, new technological developments,\\nincluding the development and use of generative artificial intelligence, are rapidly evolving. If our competitors gain an advantage by using such technologies\\nmore effectively to satisfy consumer demand, our ability to compete successfully and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. Companies also\\nmay enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Piracy also threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental\\nproposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. In light of the compelling consumer proposition,\\npiracy services are subject to rapid global growth, and our efforts to prevent that growth may be insufficient. If we are unable to successfully or profitably\\ncompete with current and new competitors and win moments of truth, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain\\nmarket share, revenues or profitability.\\nWe face risks, such as unforeseen costs and potential liability in connection with content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute through our\\nservice.\\nAs a producer and distributor of content, we face potential liability for negligence, copyright and trademark infringement, or other claims based on the\\nnature and content of materials that we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute. We also may face potential liability for content used in promoting our\\nservice, including marketing materials. We devote significant resources toward the development, production, marketing and distribution of original\\nprogramming. We believe that original and exclusive programming can help differentiate our service from other offerings, enhance our brand and otherwise\\nattract and retain members. To the extent our programming does not meet our expectations, in particular, in terms of costs, viewing and popularity, our\\nbusiness, including our brand and results of operations may be adversely impacted. As a content producer, we are responsible for production costs and other\\nexpenses, such as ongoing guild payments, and take on risks associated with production, such as completion and key talent risk. Further, negotiations or\\nrenewals related to entertainment industry collective bargaining agreements have, and in the future, could negatively impact timing and costs associated with\\nour productions. We contract with third parties related to the development, production, marketing and distribution of our original programming. We may face\\npotential liability or may suffer significant losses in connection with these arrangements, including but not limited to if such third parties violate applicable law,\\nbecome insolvent or engage in fraudulent behavior. To the extent we create and sell physical or digital merchandise relating to our programming, and/or license\\nsuch rights to third parties, we could become subject to product liability, intellectual property or other claims related to such merchandise. We may decide to\\nremove content from our service, not to place licensed or produced content on our service or discontinue or alter production of original content if we believe\\nsuch content might not be well received by our members, is prohibited by law, or could be damaging to our brand or business.\\nTo the extent we do not accurately anticipate costs or mitigate risks, including for content that we obtain but ultimately does not appear on or is removed\\nfrom our service, or if we become liable for content we acquire, produce, license and/or distribute, our business may suffer. Litigation to defend these claims\\ncould be costly and the expenses and damages arising from any liability or unforeseen production risks could harm our results of operations. We may not be\\nindemnified against claims or costs of these types and we may not have insurance coverage for these types of claims.\\nIf we are not able to manage change and growth, our business could be adversely affected.\\nWe are expanding our operations, scaling our streaming service to effectively and reliably handle anticipated growth in both members and features related\\nto our services, such as introducing games and advertising on our service, as well as offering live programming and expanding our consumer products and\\nexperiences. We are also scaling our own studio operations to produce original content. As our international offering evolves, we are managing and adjusting\\nour business to address varied content offerings, consumer customs and practices, in particular those dealing with e-commerce and streaming video, as well as\\ndiffering legal and regulatory environments. As we scale our streaming service and introduce new features such as our ad-supported subscription plan and live\\nprogramming, we are developing technology and utilizing third-party “cloud” computing, technology and other services. As we scale our content production,\\nincluding games, and introduce new features and expand our consumer products and experience offerings, we are building out expertise in a number of\\ndisciplines, including creative, marketing, legal, finance, licensing, merchandising and other resources, which requires significant resources and management\\nattention. Further, we may expand our content and service offerings in a manner that is not well received by consumers. As we grow our operations, we may\\nface integration and operational challenges as well as potential unknown liabilities and reputational concerns in connection with partners we work with or\\ncompanies we may acquire or control. If we are not able to manage the growing complexity of our business, including improving, refining or evolving our\\ncorporate culture, as well as our systems and operational practices related to our streaming operations and original content, our business may be adversely\\naffected.\\nIf we fail to maintain a positive reputation concerning our service and the content we offer, we may not be able to attract or retain members, we may\\nface regulatory scrutiny and our operating results may be adversely affected.\\nWe believe that a positive reputation concerning our service is important in attracting and retaining members. To the extent our content is perceived as\\nlow quality, offensive or otherwise not compelling to consumers, our ability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may be adversely impacted. To the\\nextent our content is deemed controversial or offensive by government regulators, we may face direct or indirect\\n5'),\n",

We could also face boycotts which could adversely affect our business. Furthermore, to the\\nextent our response to government action or our marketing, customer service and public relations efforts are not effective or result in negative reaction, our\\nability to establish and maintain a positive reputation may likewise be adversely impacted. There is an increasing focus from regulators, investors, members\\nand other stakeholders on environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters, both in the United States and internationally, including the adoption of new\\ndisclosure and regulatory frameworks. To the extent we are unable to meet regulatory or industry standards or investor expectations on ESG issues or the\\ncontent we distribute and the manner in which we produce content creates ESG related concerns, our reputation may be harmed.\\nOur business could be adversely impacted by costs and challenges associated with strategic acquisitions and investments.\\nFrom time to time, we acquire or invest in businesses, content, and technologies that support our business. The risks associated with such acquisitions or\\ninvestments (some of which may be unforeseen) include the difficulty of integrating solutions, operations, and personnel; inheriting liabilities and exposure to\\nlitigation; failure to realize anticipated benefits and expected synergies; and diversion of management’s time and attention, among other acquisition-related\\nrisks.\\nWe may not be successful in overcoming such risks, and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business. In addition, if we do not\\ncomplete an announced acquisition transaction or integrate an acquired business successfully and in a timely manner, we may not realize the benefits of the\\nacquisition to the extent anticipated. Acquisitions and investments may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly financial results. These fluctuations could\\narise from transaction-related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write-offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with\\nacquisitions and investments, and could negatively impact our financial results.\\nWe rely upon a number of partners to make our service available on their devices.\\nWe currently offer members the ability to receive streaming content through a host of internet-connected devices, including TVs, digital video players,\\nTV set-top boxes and mobile devices. We have agreements with various cable, satellite and telecommunications operators to make our service available\\nthrough the TV set-top boxes of these service providers, some of which compete directly with us or have investments in competing streaming content\\nproviders. In many instances, our agreements also include provisions by which the partner bills consumers directly for the Netflix service or otherwise offers\\nservices or products in connection with offering our service. If partners or other providers do a better job of connecting consumers with content they want to\\nwatch, for example through multi-service discovery interfaces, our service may be adversely impacted. We intend to continue to broaden our relationships with\\nexisting partners and to increase our capability to stream content and offer games to other platforms and partners over time. If we are not successful in\\nmaintaining existing and creating new relationships, or if we encounter technological, content licensing, regulatory, business or other impediments to delivering\\nour streaming content to our members via these devices, our ability to retain members and grow our business could be adversely impacted.\\nOur agreements with our partners are typically between one and three years in duration and our business could be adversely affected if, upon expiration, a\\nnumber of our partners do not continue to provide access to our service or are unwilling to do so on terms acceptable to us, which terms may include the degree\\nof accessibility and prominence of our service. Furthermore, devices are manufactured and sold by entities other than Netflix and while these entities should be\\nresponsible for the devices’ performance, the connection between these devices and our service may nonetheless result in consumer dissatisfaction toward us\\nand such dissatisfaction could result in claims against us or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, technology changes to our streaming\\nfunctionality may require that partners update their devices, and from time to time, lead to us to stop supporting the delivery of our service on certain legacy\\ndevices. If partners do not update or otherwise modify their devices, or if we discontinue support for certain devices, our service and our members' use and\\nenjoyment could be negatively impacted.\\nWe are subject to payment processing risk.\\nOur members pay for our service using a variety of different payment methods, including credit and debit cards, gift cards, prepaid cards, direct debit,\\nonline wallets and direct carrier and partner billing. We rely on internal systems and those of third parties to process payment. Acceptance and processing of\\nthese payment methods are subject to certain rules, regulations, and industry standards, including data storage requirements, additional authentication\\nrequirements for certain payment methods, and require payment of interchange and other fees. To the extent there are increases in payment processing fees,\\nmaterial changes in the payment ecosystem, such as large re-issuances of payment cards, delays in receiving payments from payment processors, changes to\\nrules, regulations or industry standards concerning payments, loss of payment partners and/or disruptions or failures in our payment processing systems,\\npartner systems or payment products, including products we use to update payment information, our revenue, operating expenses and results of operations\\ncould be adversely impacted. In certain instances, we leverage third parties such as our cable and other partners to bill members on our behalf. If these third\\nparties become unwilling or unable to continue processing payments on our behalf, we would have to transition members or otherwise find alternative methods\\nof collecting payments, which could adversely impact member acquisition and retention. In addition, from time to time, we encounter fraudulent use of\\npayment methods, which could impact our results of operations and if not adequately controlled and managed could create negative consumer perceptions of\\nour service. If we are unable to maintain our fraud and chargeback rate at acceptable levels, card networks may\\n6\"),\n",

The termination of our ability to\\nprocess payments on any major payment method would significantly impair our ability to operate our business.\\nIf government regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business change, we may need to alter the manner in which we conduct our\\nbusiness, or incur greater operating expenses.\\nThe adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the\\nmanner in which we currently conduct our business. As our service and others like us gain traction in international markets, governments are increasingly\\nlooking to introduce new or extend legacy regulations to these services, in particular those related to broadcast media and tax. For example, European law\\nenables individual member states to impose levies and other financial obligations on media operators that provide services in their jurisdiction. Several\\nEuropean Union (EU) Member States have and others may, over time, impose financial and regulatory obligations on us. In addition, the continued growth and\\ndevelopment of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection laws, which may impose additional burdens on us. Rules\\ngoverning new technological developments, including generative artificial intelligence, are nascent and rapidly evolving such that the impact on areas related to\\nour business remains uncertain. For example, in Europe, the Digital Markets Act remains subject to non-compliance investigations, the result of which could\\nchange how we interact with digital gatekeepers like Apple and Google. If we are required to comply with new regulations or legislation or new interpretations\\nof existing regulations or legislation, this compliance could cause us to incur additional expenses or alter our business model.\\nChanges in laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the internet, including laws impacting net neutrality, requiring\\npayment of network access fees or payment of network support taxes, could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of doing business.\\nCertain laws intended to prevent network operators from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their networks have been implemented in many\\ncountries, including across the EU and several U.S. states. In others, the laws may be nascent, evolving or non-existent. For example, a U.S. federal appeals\\ncourt recently overturned the Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality rules. Given uncertainty around these rules, including changing\\ninterpretations, amendments or repeal, coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operators, we could experience\\ndiscriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business.\\nWe are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's\\ntime and attention.\\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we\\nhave seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included copyright and other claims related to our content, products, patent\\ninfringement claims, tax litigation, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to\\ndefend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in content unavailability, service disruptions, and otherwise occupy a significant\\namount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also receive inquiries\\nand subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities, and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to\\nour business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such\\nmatters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things,\\nmodification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and\\nfinancial position.\\nOur advertising offering is new and subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may adversely affect our business.\\nWe have limited experience and operating history offering advertising on our service, and our advertising revenue may not grow as we expect. Our ability\\nto generate advertising revenue is subject to various risks and will depend on a number of factors, including:\\n•our ability to attract and retain advertisers;\\n•fluctuations in memberships, including those selecting the ad-supported subscription plan, and member engagement;\\n•the quantity or quality of ads shown to our members;\\n•our ability to compete effectively for advertising spend;\\n•the impact of seasonal, cyclical or other shifts in advertising spend, including the impact of macroeconomic conditions;\\n•the availability, accuracy, utility, and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our\\nads to marketers, or our ability to further improve such tools;\\n•changes in the way advertising on devices, connected TVs or on personal computers is measured or priced;\\n•adverse legal developments relating to advertising or measurement tools;\\n•changes in third-party policies, which may negatively impact the ability to measure, deliver and select ads to be served;\\n•regulatory, legislative and industry developments relating to the collection and use of information and other privacy considerations, including\\nregulations related to ad targeting and measurement tools;\\n•any liability or reputational harm from advertisements shown on our service;\\n7\"),\n",

The license periods and the terms and conditions of such rights vary. As content providers develop their own streaming services, they\\nmay be unwilling to provide us with access to certain content, including popular series or movies. If the studios, content providers and other rights holders are\\nnot or are no longer willing or able to license us content upon terms acceptable to us, our ability to stream content to our members may be adversely affected\\nand/or our costs could increase. Certain licenses for content provide for the studios or other content providers to withdraw content from our service relatively\\nquickly. Because of these provisions and other actions we may take, content available through our service can be withdrawn on short notice. As competition\\nincreases, we see the cost of certain programming increase. As we seek to differentiate our service, we are often focused on securing certain exclusive rights\\nwhen obtaining content, including original content. We are also focused on programming an overall mix of content that delights our members in a cost efficient\\nmanner. Within this context, we are selective about the titles we add and renew to our service. If we do not maintain a compelling mix of content, our member\\nacquisition and retention may be adversely affected.\\nMusic and certain authors’ performances contained within content we distribute may require us to obtain licenses for such distribution. In this regard, we\\nengage in negotiations with collection management organizations (“CMOs”) and similar entities that hold certain rights to music and/or other interests in\\nintellectual property (e.g., remuneration rights) in connection with streaming content into various territories. If we are unable to reach mutually acceptable\\nterms with these organizations, we could become involved in litigation and/or could be enjoined from distributing certain content, which could adversely\\nimpact our business. Additionally, pending and ongoing litigation and negotiations between certain CMOs and other third parties in various territories could\\nadversely impact our negotiations with CMOs, or result in music publishers represented by certain CMOs unilaterally withdrawing rights, and thereby\\nadversely impact our ability to reach licensing agreements reasonably acceptable to us. Failure to reach such licensing agreements could expose us to potential\\nliability for copyright infringement or otherwise increase our costs. Additionally, as the market for the digital distribution of content grows, a broader role for\\nCMOs in the remuneration of authors, performers and other beneficiaries of neighboring rights is likely to expose us to greater distribution expenses in certain\\nmarkets.\\nIf our trademarks and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our brand\\nand other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.\\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties with\\nwhom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. We may also seek to\\nenforce our proprietary rights through court proceedings or other legal actions. We have filed and we expect to file from time to time for trademark, copyright,\\nand patent applications. Nevertheless, these applications may not be approved, third parties may challenge any copyrights, patents or trademarks issued to or\\nheld by us, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property rights, and we may not be able to prevent infringement or\\nmisappropriation without substantial expense to us. If the protection of our intellectual property rights is inadequate to prevent use or misappropriation by third\\nparties, the value of our brand, content, and other intangible assets may be diminished, competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and\\nmethods of operations, the perception of our business and service to members and potential members may become confused in the marketplace, and our ability\\nto attract members may be adversely affected.\\nWe currently hold various domain names relating to our brand, including Netflix.com. Failure to protect our domain names could adversely affect our\\nreputation and brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website and our service. We may be unable, without significant cost or at all, to prevent\\nthird parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights.\\nIntellectual property claims against us could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights related to, among other things, our technology,\\nbusiness processes, and content.\\nTrademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property rights are important to us and other companies.

We use the intellectual property of third parties in creating some of our content, merchandising our products\\nand experiences, and marketing our service. From time to time, third parties allege that we have infringed or otherwise violated their intellectual property\\nrights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use, or develop non-infringing technology or otherwise alter our business practices\\non a timely basis in response to claims against us for infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our\\nbusiness and competitive position may be adversely affected. In addition, the use or adoption of new and emerging technologies may increase our exposure to\\nintellectual property claims, and the availability of copyright and other intellectual property protection for AI-generated material is uncertain. Many companies\\nare devoting significant resources to developing patents that could potentially affect many aspects of our business. There are numerous patents that broadly\\nclaim means and methods of conducting business on the internet. We have not searched for patents relative to our technology. Defending ourselves against\\nintellectual property claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, results in costly litigation and diversion of technical and\\nmanagement personnel. It also may result in our inability to use our current technology and products, our recommendation and merchandising technology or\\ninability to market our service or merchandise our products. We may also have to remove content from our service, or remove consumer products or marketing\\nmaterials from the marketplace. As a result of a dispute, we may have to develop non-infringing technology, enter into royalty or licensing agreements, adjust\\nour content, merchandising or marketing activities or take other actions to resolve the claims. These actions, if required, may be costly or unavailable on terms\\nacceptable to us.\\nRisks Related to Information Technology\\nAny significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including\\nthose relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized access, disclosure or\\ndestruction of data, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could\\nadversely impact our business.\\nOur reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our members is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of our computer systems and\\nthose of third parties that we utilize in our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, earthquakes, adverse\\nweather conditions, other natural disasters, public health issues such as pandemics or epidemics, terrorist attacks, rogue employees, power loss,\\ntelecommunications failures, cybersecurity risks and incidents, and other interruptions beyond our control. Interruptions in these systems, or with the internet in\\ngeneral, could make our service unavailable or degraded or otherwise hinder our ability to deliver our service. Service interruptions, errors in our software or\\nthe unavailability of computer systems or data used in our operations could diminish the overall attractiveness of our service to existing and potential members.\\nOur computer systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are subject to constantly evolving cybersecurity threats, including cyber-attacks\\nsuch as computer viruses, malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, physical or electronic break-ins, or insider threats, as well as misconfigurations in\\ninformation systems, networks, software or hardware, and similar disruptions or errors. These systems and those of third parties with which we do business\\nhave experienced and may continue to experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss,\\nmisuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members) and other data, confidential information or intellectual property. We and\\nmany of the third parties we work with rely on open source software and libraries that are integrated into a variety of applications, tools and systems, which\\nmay increase our exposure to vulnerabilities. The addition of new features or upgrades also increases our exposure to vulnerabilities, and generative artificial\\nintelligence could intensify these cybersecurity risks. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to induce employees, vendors, partners, or users to disclose\\nsensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data. Any attempt by hackers to obtain our data (including member and corporate information) or\\nintellectual property (including digital content assets), disrupt our service, or otherwise access our systems, or those of third parties we use, if successful, could\\nharm our business, be expensive to remedy and damage our reputation. We have implemented certain systems and processes to thwart hackers and protect our\\ndata and systems. However, the techniques used to gain unauthorized access to data and software are constantly evolving, and we may be unable to anticipate,\\ndetect or prevent unauthorized access or address all cybersecurity incidents that occur. Because of our prominence, we (and/or third parties we use) have been\\nand may continue to be a particularly attractive target for such attacks, and from time to time, we have experienced unauthorized releases of certain digital\\ncontent assets and unintended disclosure of personal information due to incidents related to third parties. However, to date these unauthorized releases have not\\nhad a material impact on our service, systems or business. There is no assurance that hackers may not have a material impact on our service or systems in the\\nfuture. We do not carry insurance to cover expenses related to such disruptions or unauthorized access. Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or\\notherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement and maintain. These efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies\\nchange and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated, and may limit the functionality of or otherwise negatively impact our service\\noffering and systems. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members, damage our reputation, and adversely\\naffect our business and results of operations. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal\\ninformation could subject us to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and\\nresults of operations.\\nWe utilize our own communications and computer hardware systems located either in our facilities or in that of a third-party provider. In addition, we\\nutilize third-party “cloud” computing services in connection with our business operations. We also utilize our own and third-party\\n9'),\n",

Problems faced by us or\\nour third-party “cloud” computing or other network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats and\\nregulatory interference, could adversely impact the experience of our members.\\nWe rely upon Amazon Web Services to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Amazon Web\\nServices operation would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\\nAmazon Web Services (“AWS”) provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a\\n\"cloud\" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services\\nprovided by AWS. Currently, we run the vast majority of our computing on AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot easily switch our AWS\\noperations to another cloud provider, any commercial disputes related to, disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and\\nour business would be adversely impacted. While the retail side of Amazon competes with us, we do not believe that Amazon will use the AWS operation in\\nsuch a manner as to gain competitive advantage against our service, although if it were to do so it could harm our business.\\nIf the technology we use in operating our business fails, is unavailable, or does not operate to expectations, our business and results of operations\\ncould be adversely impacted.\\nWe utilize a combination of proprietary and third-party technology to operate our business. This includes the technology that we have developed to\\nrecommend and merchandise content to our consumers as well as enable fast and efficient delivery of content to our members and their various consumer\\nelectronic devices. For example, we have built and deployed our own CDN. To the extent Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) do not interconnect with our\\nCDN or charge us to access their networks, or if we experience difficulties in our CDN’s operation, our ability to efficiently and effectively deliver our\\nstreaming content to our members could be adversely impacted and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Likewise, if our\\nrecommendation and merchandising technology does not enable us to predict and recommend titles that our members will enjoy, our ability to attract and retain\\nmembers may be adversely affected. We also utilize third-party technology to help market our service, process payments, and otherwise manage the daily\\noperations of our business. If our technology or that of third-parties we utilize in our operations fails or otherwise operates improperly, including as a result of\\n“bugs” or other errors in our development and deployment of software, our ability to operate our service, retain existing members and add new members may\\nbe impaired. Any harm to our members’ devices caused by software used in our operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations\\nand financial condition.\\nChanges in how network operators handle and charge for access to data that travel across their networks could adversely impact our business.\\nWe rely upon the ability of consumers to access our service through the internet. If network operators block, restrict or otherwise impair access to our\\nservice over their networks, our service and business could be negatively affected. To the extent that network operators implement usage based pricing,\\nincluding meaningful bandwidth caps, or otherwise try to monetize access to their networks by data providers, we could incur greater operating expenses and\\nour member acquisition and retention could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, to the extent network operators create tiers of internet access service and\\neither charge us for or prohibit us from being available through these tiers, our business could be negatively impacted.\\nMost network operators that provide consumers with access to the internet also provide these consumers with multichannel video programming. As such,\\nmany network operators have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in a manner adverse to our continued growth and success. While we believe that\\nconsumer demand, regulatory oversight and competition will help counterbalance these incentives, to the extent that network operators are able to provide\\npreferential treatment to their data as opposed to ours or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practices, our business could be negatively\\nimpacted. The extent to which these incentives limit operator behavior differs across markets.\\nRisks Related to Privacy\\nPrivacy concerns could limit our ability to collect and leverage member personal information and disclosure of member personal information could\\nadversely impact our business and reputation.\\nIn the ordinary course of business and in particular in connection with content acquisition, merchandising our service to our members and our advertising\\noffering, we collect and utilize information supplied by our members and third parties, which may include personal information and other data.

Increased regulation of data utilization practices, including self-regulation or findings\\nunder existing laws that limit our ability to collect, transfer and use personal information, could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we were\\nto disclose personal information about our members in a manner that was objectionable to them, our business reputation could be adversely affected, and we\\ncould face potential legal claims that could impact our operating results. Internationally, we may become subject to additional and/or more stringent legal\\nobligations concerning our treatment of member and other personal information, such as laws regarding data localization, data transfer and/or restrictions on\\ndata export. Failure to comply with these obligations could subject us to liability, and to the extent that we need to alter our business model or practices to adapt\\nto these obligations, we could incur additional expenses.\\nOur reputation and relationships with members would be harmed if member personal information, particularly billing data, were to be accessed by\\nunauthorized persons.\\nWe maintain personal information regarding our members, including names, age, gender and billing information. This personal information is maintained\\non our own systems as well as that of third parties we use in our operations. With respect to billing information, such as credit card numbers, we rely on\\nencryption and authentication technology to secure such information. We take measures to protect against unauthorized intrusion into our members’\\ninformation. Despite these measures and technologies we, our payment processing services or other third-party services we use such as AWS, could experience\\nan unauthorized intrusion into our members’ information. In the event of such a breach, current and potential members may become unwilling to provide the\\ninformation to us necessary for them to remain or become members. We have notified and may in the future be required to notify regulators about any actual or\\nperceived data breach (including various state Attorneys General, one or more EU data protection authorities, or other data protection authorities) as well as the\\nindividuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods. Additionally, we could face legal claims or regulatory fines or penalties for such a\\nbreach. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we currently do not carry insurance against the risk of a data breach. We also maintain\\npersonal information concerning our employees, as well as personal information of others working on our productions. Should an unauthorized intrusion into\\nour members’ or employees’ personal information and/or production personal information occur, our business could be adversely affected and our larger\\nreputation with respect to data protection could be negatively impacted.\\nRisks Related to Liquidity\\nThe long-term and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity\\nand results of operations.\\nIn connection with licensing streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers. We also enter\\ninto multi-year commitments for content that we produce, either directly or through third parties, including elements associated with these productions such as\\nnon-cancelable commitments under talent agreements. The payment terms of these agreements are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership\\nbase (“fixed cost”) but may be determined by costs of production or tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such\\ncommitments, to the extent estimable under accounting standards, are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Part II, Item 7, \"Management\\'s\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our\\nconsolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Given the\\nmultiple-year duration and largely fixed cost nature of content commitments, if business performance does not meet our expectations, our margins may be\\nadversely impacted. Further, we may be unable to react to any reduction in our cash flows from operations, including those caused by a downturn in the\\neconomy, by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. Payment terms for certain content commitments, such as content we directly produce,\\nwill typically require more up-front cash payments than other content licenses or arrangements whereby we do not fund the production of such content. To the\\nextent revenue growth does not meet our expectations, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of content commitments\\nand accelerated payment requirements of certain agreements. In addition, the long-term and largely fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our\\nflexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in our business and the market segments in which we operate. If we license and/or produce content that is not\\nfavorably received by consumers in a territory, or is unable to be shown in a territory, acquisition and retention may be adversely impacted and given the long-\\nterm and fixed cost nature of our content commitments, we may not be able to adjust our content offerings quickly and our results of operations may be\\nadversely impacted.\\nWe may seek additional capital that may result in stockholder dilution or that may have rights senior to those of our common stockholders.\\nFrom time to time, we may seek to obtain additional capital, either through equity, equity-linked or debt securities. The decision to obtain additional\\ncapital will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance and condition of the capital markets. Rising interest rates or any\\ndisruption in the capital markets could make it more difficult and expensive for us to raise additional capital or refinance\\n11'),\n",

If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights,\\npreferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution. Any large equity or equity-linked offering\\ncould also negatively impact our stock price.\\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could adversely affect our\\nfinancial position, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and other obligations.\\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we may incur additional\\nindebtedness in the future and incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. Our ability to make payments on our debt and other\\nobligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain\\nfinancial, business and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to service our debt and other obligations from cash flows, we may need to refinance\\nor restructure all or a portion of such obligations prior to maturity. If the financial markets become difficult or costly to access, including due to rising interest\\nrates, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or other changes in economic conditions, our ability to raise additional capital may be negatively\\nimpacted, and any refinancing or restructuring could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further\\nrestrict our business operations.\\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had the equivalent of $15.7 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding (“Notes”), some of which is\\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a $3 billion unsecured\\nrevolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2024, we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2024, we had\\napproximately $6.2 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet, some of which is denominated in currencies other than the\\nU.S. dollar. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are\\nsignificant. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may require us to use a substantial portion of our cash\\nflow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due, limit our ability to borrow additional funds, limit our flexibility to\\nplan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors. For more\\ninformation on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, in the\\naccompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report\\non Form 10-K.\\nRisks Related to International Operations\\nWe could be subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international operations.\\nOperating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and will subject us to economic, political, regulatory and\\nother risks that may be different from or incremental to those in the U.S. In addition to the risks that we face in the U.S., our international operations involve\\nrisks that could adversely affect our business, including:\\n•the need to adapt our content and user interfaces for specific cultural and language differences;\\n•difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\\n•political or social unrest, global hostilities, and economic instability;\\n•compliance with laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws, export controls and economic\\nsanctions, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials;\\n•difficulties in understanding and complying with local laws, regulations and customs in foreign jurisdictions;\\n•regulatory requirements or government action, whether in response to enforcement of actual or purported legal and regulatory requirements or\\notherwise, that results in disruption or non-availability of our service or particular content, administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and\\ncriminal liability, or increased operating costs in the applicable jurisdiction;\\n•application of foreign intellectual property laws, which requires the business to adapt to bespoke compliance rules, or changes to such laws, among\\nother issues, may impact the economics of creating or distributing content, anti-piracy efforts, or our ability to protect or exploit intellectual property\\nrights;\\n•adverse tax consequences such as those related to changes in tax laws or tax rates or their interpretations, and the related application of judgment in\\ndetermining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities or other tax liabilities given the ultimate tax determination is\\nuncertain;\\n•fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which have and may continue to impact revenues and expenses of our international operations and expose us\\nto foreign currency exchange rate risk, and while we use derivative and non-derivative instruments to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in\\nexchange rates, the use of such hedging activities may not be effective in offsetting an adverse financial impact and may introduce or heighten\\ncounterparty risk and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures;\\n•rates of inflation;\\n•profit repatriation, currency control regulations and other restrictions on the transfer of funds;\\n•differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards;\\n•new and different sources of competition;\\n12'),\n",

For example, the EU revised its\\nAudio Visual Media Services Directive in 2018 to require that European works comprise at least thirty percent (30%) of media service providers’\\ncatalogs, and to require prominence of those works, and certain EU Member States have imposed additional investment obligations and levies.\\nThese and other factors may cause us to adjust our business plans, including expanding or ceasing certain operations in certain countries, and the\\nexecution of our strategies. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and our overall business, and results\\nof our operations.\\nWe are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining\\nour global provision for income taxes, deferred taxes and other tax liabilities and receivables, and in evaluating our tax positions and other tax attributes on a\\nworldwide basis. We are subject to the periodic examination of our domestic and foreign tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, state, local, and foreign\\ntax authorities, some of whom are challenging our tax positions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations in\\ndetermining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax\\npositions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes. If the ultimate determination of\\nincome and other tax liabilities differ from the amounts recorded or accrued, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely\\nimpacted.\\nTax laws are regularly being re-examined and evaluated globally. New laws and interpretations of the law are taken into account for financial statement\\npurposes in the quarter or year that they become applicable. Tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies and we have tax audits\\npending in several jurisdictions. The U.S. federal and state governments, countries in the EU, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as\\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax\\nobligations in jurisdictions where we do business. If U.S. or other tax authorities change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge how or where our profits\\nare currently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\\nRisks Related to Human Resources\\nWe may lose key employees or may be unable to hire qualified employees, and the failure to maintain and improve our company culture may\\nadversely affect our business.\\nWe rely on the continued service of our senior management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, members of our\\nexecutive team and other key employees. In our industry, there is substantial and continuous competition for highly-skilled business, product development,\\ntechnical, creative and other personnel. If we experience high executive turnover, fail to adapt our business practices to industry expectations, fail to maintain a\\npositive reputation, fail to implement succession plans for key employees, encounter difficulties associated with the transition of members of our management\\nteam, are not successful in recruiting new personnel or in retaining and motivating existing personnel, in instilling our culture in new employees, or\\nmaintaining and improving our culture as we grow, our operations may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\\nLabor disputes may have an adverse effect on the Company’s business.\\nWe and our partners, suppliers, and vendors engage writers, directors, actors, other talent, trade employees and others who are subject to collective\\nbargaining agreements in the motion picture industry, both in the U.S. and internationally. Expiring collective bargaining agreements may be renewed on terms\\nthat are unfavorable to us. If expiring collective bargaining agreements cannot be renewed, affected unions have, and could in the future, take action in the form\\nof strikes or work stoppages. Such work stoppages have resulted, and may in the future result, in halted productions and delays in our ability to provide new\\ncontent to our members. Such actions, as well as higher costs or operating complexities in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a\\nsignificant labor dispute, could have an adverse effect on our business by causing delays in production, added costs or by reducing profit margins, and our\\nability to provide new content to our members could likewise be delayed or dropped.\\n13'),\n",

Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a\\nbusiness combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board\\nof directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\\nIn addition, a merger or acquisition may trigger retention payments to certain executive employees under the terms of our Amended and Restated\\nExecutive Severance and Retention Incentive Plan, thereby increasing the cost of such a transaction.\\nOur stock price is volatile.\\nThe price at which our common stock has traded has fluctuated significantly. The price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including\\nthe following, some of which are beyond our control:\\n•variations in our operating results, including our membership acquisition and retention, revenues, operating income, net income, net cash provided by\\noperating activities and free cash flow;\\n•variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\\n•announcements of developments affecting our business, systems or expansion plans by us or others;\\n•competition, including the introduction of new competitors, their pricing strategies and services;\\n•market volatility in general;\\n•the level of demand for our stock, including the amount of short interest in our stock;\\n•the impact of our current stock repurchase program and any future stock repurchase program we may adopt;\\n•the operating results of our competitors; and\\n•other risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors.\\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\\nFollowing certain periods of volatility in the market price of our securities, we became the subject of securities litigation. We may experience more such\\nlitigation following future periods of volatility. This type of litigation may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources.\\nPreparing and forecasting our financial results requires us to make judgments and estimates which may differ materially from actual results.\\nGiven the dynamic nature of our business, and the inherent limitations in predicting the future, forecasts of our revenues, operating margins, net income\\nand other financial and operating data may differ materially from actual results. Also, predicting consumer adoption of various pricing strategies, such as the\\nad-supported subscription plan or efforts to limit multi-household usage, and new revenue streams, such as advertising revenue, is inherently difficult given the\\nlack of operating history with respect to such offerings, and actual results may differ significantly from the expectations of our management, securities analysts\\nor investors. Such discrepancies could cause a decline in the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the preparation of consolidated financial\\nstatements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America also requires management to make estimates and\\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and\\nthe reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. We base such estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions\\nthat we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, but actual results may differ from these estimates. For example, we estimate the content amortization\\npattern, beginning with the month of first availability, of any particular licensed or produced television series, documentary or feature film based upon various\\nfactors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the\\n14'),\n",

If we revise such estimates it could\\nresult in greater in-period expenses, which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report which could negatively\\nimpact our stock price. Further, events outside of our control may cause actual results to differ from our forecast.\\nItem 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\\nNone.\\nItem 1C. Cybersecurity\\nWe have an enterprise-wide information security program designed to identify, protect, detect and respond to and manage reasonably foreseeable\\ncybersecurity risks and threats. To protect our information systems from cybersecurity threats, we use various security tools that help prevent, identify, escalate,\\ninvestigate, resolve and recover from identified vulnerabilities and security incidents in a timely manner. These include, but are not limited to, internal\\nreporting, monitoring and detection tools, and a bug bounty program to allow security researchers to assist us in identifying vulnerabilities in our products\\nbefore they are exploited by malicious threat actors. We also maintain a third party security program to identify, prioritize, assess, mitigate and remediate third\\nparty risks; however, we rely on the third parties we use to implement security programs commensurate with their risk, and we cannot ensure in all\\ncircumstances that their efforts will be successful.\\nWe regularly assess risks from cybersecurity and technology threats and monitor our information systems for potential vulnerabilities. We use a widely-\\nadopted risk quantification model to identify, measure and prioritize cybersecurity and technology risks and develop related security controls and safeguards.\\nWe conduct regular reviews and tests of our information security program and also leverage audits by our internal audit team, tabletop exercises, penetration\\nand vulnerability testing, red team exercises, simulations, and other exercises to evaluate the effectiveness of our information security program and improve our\\nsecurity measures and planning. We also engage an external auditor to conduct an annual payment card industry data security standard review of our security\\ncontrols protecting payment information, as well as third-party penetration testing of our cardholder environment and related systems. The results of these\\nassessments are reported to the Audit Committee.\\nOur systems and those of third parties with which we do business have experienced and may continue to experience directed attacks intended to lead to\\ninterruptions and delays in our service and operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of personal information (of third parties, employees, and our members)\\nand other data, confidential information or intellectual property, and we have experienced unauthorized releases of certain digital content assets and unintended\\ndisclosure of personal information due to incidents related to third parties. However, to date these incidents have not had a material impact on our service,\\nsystems or business. Any significant disruption to our service or access to our systems could result in a loss of members and adversely affect our business and\\nresults of operation. Further, a penetration of our systems or a third-party’s systems or other misappropriation or misuse of personal information could subject\\nus to business, regulatory, litigation and reputation risk, which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See\\n\"Risk Factors - Any significant disruption in or unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of third parties that we utilize in our operations, including\\nthose relating to cybersecurity or arising from cyber-attacks, could result in a loss or degradation of service, unauthorized access, disclosure or destruction of\\ndata, including member and corporate information, or theft of intellectual property, including digital content assets, which could adversely impact our\\nbusiness.\"\\nThe Vice President of Security and Privacy Engineering leads our global information security organization responsible for overseeing the Netflix\\ninformation security program.

Voluntary cancellations generally become ef fective at the end of the prepaid membership period. Involuntary\\ncancellations, as a result of a failed method of payment, become ef fective immediately . Memberships are assigned to territories based on the geographic location used at time of\\nsign-up as determined by the Company’ s internal systems, which utilize industry standard geo-location technology .\\n(3) We believe the non-GAAP  financial measure of constant currency revenue is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership\\n(“ARM”) absent foreign currency fluctuations. However , this non-GAAP  financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for , or superior to other\\nfinancial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP .\\nIn order to exclude the ef fect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on ARM, we calculate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with\\nforeign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior -year period and exclude the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues. Constant currency\\npercentage change in ARM is calculated as the percentage change between current period constant currency ARM and the prior comparative period ARM. The impact of hedging\\ngains or losses is excluded from both the current and prior periods. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our revenues would have been approximately $1,424 million higher ,\\nexcluding the impact of hedging and had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December 31, 2023. The unfavorable foreign\\nexchange rate impacts in the year ended December 31, 2024 were primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the U.S. dollar coupled with significant\\nprice increases in the local currency in this jurisdiction.\\nOperating margin for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased six percentage points as compared to the prior comparative period, primarily due to\\nrevenues growing at a faster rate as compared to the growth in cost of revenues, sales and marketing, and technology and development expenses, coupled with\\nlower general and administrative expenses.\\n19'),\n",

We may not be able to obtain such\\nfinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights,\\npreferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\\nIn September 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock, with no expiration date, and in December\\n2024, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $15 billion, also with no expiration date.

An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a\\ntitle becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The contractual\\nobligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year\\nto more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4\\nbillion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing\\nrange is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ.

The Securities and Exchange Commission\\n(\"SEC\") has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results\\nof operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical\\naccounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be\\nreasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\\nContent\\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The\\ncontent licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more\\nupfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are\\nclassified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the\\nfee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is\\naccepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and\\nproduction overhead.\\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of revenues” on the\\nConsolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with\\nthe month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically expect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more\\naccelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its\\nmonth of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require\\nconsiderable management judgment.\\nIn the normal course of business, we, or a third-party producing content on our behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on\\nproductions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive\\nis earned. In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on our service. Upon a title’s launch, any\\namounts we are eligible for through qualified production spend but have not received, are recognized in “Other current assets” or “Other non-current assets” on\\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets (presented in\\n“Content assets, net”) and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in “Cost of revenues”) on the Consolidated Statements of\\nOperations.\\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are\\npredominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected\\nusefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If\\nsuch changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized\\ncosts for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method.\\nDeferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying\\namounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax\\nassets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is\\nreduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not they will not be realized.\\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of\\nany tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past\\noperating results, our forecast of future earnings and future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in\\ndetermining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business.\\nActual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.\\n26'),\n",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency\\nfluctuations.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nAt December 31, 2024, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds and time deposits. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with\\nthe prevailing interest rate. Our short-term investments are primarily comprised of investments in government securities. These securities are classified as\\navailable-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”)\\nwithin Stockholders\\' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these securities.\\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $15.7 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in fifteen tranches due between 2025 and 2054. Refer to\\nNote 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates,\\nincreasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on\\nchanges in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\\nForeign Currency Risk\\nWe operate our business globally and transact in multiple currencies. Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 56% of revenue\\nand 29% of operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily\\nthe euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, Argentine peso, and the Mexican peso.\\nAccordingly, volatility in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue\\nand operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues, our revenues for the year ended\\nDecember 31, 2024 would have been approximately $1,424 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those in the same\\nperiod of 2023. The unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact in the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentine\\npeso relative to the U.S. dollar coupled with significant price increases in the local currency in this jurisdiction. See Part II, Item 7, \"Management’s Discussion\\nand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency.\\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues from changes in foreign currency\\nexchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to\\nhedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue and initially record the gains or losses on\\nthese derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into “Revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same\\nperiod the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the U.S dollar weakened by 10% as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in\\nAOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $1.9 billion and $958 million lower, respectively. This adverse\\nchange in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying forecasted revenues when recognized in\\nearnings.\\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted and firmly committed U.S. dollar-equivalent transactions related\\nto the licensing and production of content assets from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate,\\nthe effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and\\ninitially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into “Cost of Revenues” to offset the\\nhedged exposures as they affect earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. If the U.S dollar strengthened by 10% as of\\nDecember 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been\\napproximately $187 million and $71 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign\\ncurrency change in the underlying exposures when recognized in earnings.\\n27'),\n",

These non-derivative\\ninstruments may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures.\\nWe designate a portion of our foreign currency-denominated Senior Notes in euros as net investment hedges and the gains or losses on these non-derivative\\ninstruments are reported as a component of AOCI and remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts\\nrecognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.\\nWe have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the\\nremeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December 31, 2024, we\\nbegan entering into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the foreign exchange risk on intercompany transactions and monetary assets and liabilities\\nthat are not denominated in the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect\\nof foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. Certain contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and\\nthe gains or losses on these derivative instruments are recorded in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We also\\ndesignate certain contracts as fair value hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange risk on the remeasurement of our foreign-currency denominated debt. The\\ngains or losses on these derivative instruments included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in “Interest and other income (expense),” net\\nwith the offsetting foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on the hedged items. If an adverse change in exchange rates of 10% was applied to our\\nmonetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, income before\\nincome taxes would have been approximately $38 million and $516 million lower, respectively, after considering the offsetting impact of the foreign currency\\nexchange contracts and our net investment hedges. The decrease in the hypothetical adverse change in income before taxes from $516 million as of\\nDecember 31, 2023 to $38 million as of December 31, 2024 is primarily driven by our use of non-derivative and derivative instruments to mitigate foreign\\nexchange risk related to the remeasurement of foreign-currency denominated balances during the year ended December 31, 2024.\\nItem 8.

A company’s internal control over\\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect\\nthe transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being\\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nJanuary 27, 2025\\n30'),\n",

The\\nCompany amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns.\\nAuditing the amortization of the Company’s Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of\\namortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical\\nand forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization\\nwould be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.\\nHow We Addressed the\\nMatter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content\\namortization process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the content amortization method and\\nthe significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated\\nviewing patterns. We also tested management’s controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and\\naccurate.\\nTo test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method,\\ntesting the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and\\naccuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management’s assumptions by comparing them to current\\nviewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual\\nresults. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that\\ncould result from changes in the assumptions.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.\\nSan Jose, California\\nJanuary 27, 2025\\n36\"),\n",

(the “Company”) was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is one of the world’s leading\\nentertainment services with approximately 302 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, films and games across a wide variety of\\ngenres and languages. Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions\\nhave been eliminated.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") in the United States of\\nAmerica requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and\\nliabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to\\nsuch estimates and assumptions include the content asset amortization policy and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities. The\\nCompany bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.\\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these assumptions, judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted\\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic\\n740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires public entities, on an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in the rate\\nreconciliation, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,\\n2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09.\\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic\\n220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, requiring public entities to disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the\\nnotes to the financial statements on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim\\nperiods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2024-03.\\nRecently adopted accounting pronouncements\\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, requiring public\\nentities to disclose information about their reportable segments’ significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities\\nwith a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and\\nreconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 during the year ended December 31, 2024. See\\nNote 12 Segment and Geographic Information in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.\\nCash Equivalents and Short-term Investments\\nThe Company considers investments in instruments purchased with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. The Company also\\nclassifies amounts in transit from payment processors for customer credit card and debit card transactions that it expects to settle within several days as cash\\nequivalents.\\nThe Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale.\\nShort-term investments are reported at fair value, with allowances for credit losses included in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated\\nStatements of Operations and unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” within Stockholders’ equity in the\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. The Company uses the specific identification method to determine cost in calculating realized gains and losses upon the sale of\\nshort-term investments.\\n42'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'F:\\\\Multi-User Document Search and Conversational Q&A System\\\\data\\\\Netflix\\\\Netflix-10-K-01272025.pdf'}, page_content='Table of Contents\\nShort-term investments are reviewed periodically for allowances for credit losses and impairment. When evaluating the investments, the Company\\nreviews factors such as the extent to which the fair value of the security is less than the amortized cost basis, adverse conditions specifically related to the\\nsecurity, the financial condition of the issuer, the Company’s intent to sell, and whether it would be more likely than not that the Company would be required to\\nsell the investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis.\\nContent\\nThe Company acquires, licenses and produces content, including original programming, in order to offer members unlimited viewing of video\\nentertainment. The content licenses are for a fixed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of\\ncontent require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in\\nrelated liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\\nThe Company recognizes content assets (licensed and produced) as “Content assets, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, the\\nCompany capitalizes the fee per title and records a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the\\ntitle is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, the Company capitalizes costs associated with the production,\\nincluding development costs, direct costs and production overhead.\\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, the Company amortizes the content assets (licensed and produced) in “Cost of\\nrevenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title\\'s contractual window of availability or estimated period of use over ten\\nyears, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as the Company typically expects more upfront viewing, and\\nfilm amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized\\nwithin four years after its month of first availability. The Company reviews factors impacting the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. The\\nCompany\\'s estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\\nIn the normal course of business, the Company, or a third-party producing content on the Company\\'s behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through\\neligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the\\nlocation the incentive is earned. In general, tax incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on the Company’s\\nservice. Upon a title’s launch, any amounts the Company is eligible for through qualified production spend but has not received, are recognized in “Other\\ncurrent assets” or “Other non-current assets” on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a\\nreduction to the cost basis of the Company’s content assets (presented in “Content assets, net”) and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as\\npresented in “Cost of revenues”) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\nThe Company\\'s business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and\\nproduced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed in aggregate at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates\\na change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, the Company has not identified any such\\nevent or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or\\nfair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are expected to be, abandoned are written off.\\nAcquisitions\\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the\\nacquisition date. In addition, uncertain tax positions, tax-related valuation allowances and pre-acquisition contingencies are initially recorded in connection\\nwith a business combination as of the acquisition date.\\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the\\nestimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally up to 30 years, or the expected lease term for leasehold improvements, if applicable.\\nTrade Receivables\\nTrade receivables primarily consist of membership and advertising fees due to the Company. The Company evaluates the need for an allowance for credit\\nlosses based on historical collection trends, the financial condition of its payment partners, and external market factors.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nThe Company\\'s primary source of revenues is from monthly membership fees. Members are billed in advance of the start of their monthly membership\\nand revenues are recognized ratably over each monthly membership period. Revenues are presented net of the taxes that\\n43'),\n",

The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including consumer\\nelectronics (\"CE\") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), mobile operators and internet service providers (\"ISPs\"), provide\\naccess to the service as the Company retains control over service delivery to its members. In circumstances in which the price that the member pays is\\nestablished by a partner and there is no standalone price for the Netflix service (for instance, in a bundle), the net amount collected from the partner is\\nrecognized as revenue.\\nThe Company also earns revenue from advertisements presented on its streaming service, consumer products, live events and various other sources.\\nRevenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not a material component of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023,\\nand 2022. See Note 2 Revenue Recognition to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding revenues.\\nSales and Marketing\\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to marketing and advertising sales partners, including\\nCE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs. Sales and marketing expenses also include payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other\\nrelated expenses for personnel that support the Company\\'s advertising sales and marketing activities. Marketing expenses are expensed as incurred and include\\npromotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising expenses were $1,779 million, $1,732 million and $1,586 million for the years\\nended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\nIncome Taxes\\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability\\nmethod. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement\\ncarrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on\\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred\\ntax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. The Company accounts for the tax\\neffects of global intangible low tax income as a current period expense.\\nThe Company does not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a\\ntax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the\\nposition. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%\\nlikelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note\\n10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\\nForeign Currency\\nThe functional currency for the Company\\'s subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The\\nCompany translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of\\neach period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from\\nthese translations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income\" in Stockholders’ equity on the\\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each\\nperiod. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in \"Interest and other income (expense)\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\nForeign exchange gains (losses) were $(18) million, $(293) million, and $282 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\\nThese gains and losses were primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and\\ncontent liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies. Foreign exchange gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2024\\nwere net of hedging impacts. No hedging gains or losses were recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the years ended December 31, 2023\\nand 2022.

As of December 31, 2024, no amounts have been borrowed under the\\nRevolving Credit Agreement.\\nThe borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, of either (i) a floating rate per annum equal to a base rate\\n(the “Alternate Base Rate”) plus an applicable margin or (ii) a per annum rate equal to an adjusted term SOFR rate (the “Adjusted Term SOFR Rate”) plus an\\napplicable margin. The applicable margin for Alternate Base Rate loans will range from 0.00% to 0.25%, and the applicable margin for Adjusted Term SOFR\\nRate loans will range from 0.75% to 1.25%, each based on the Company’s credit ratings.\\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and negative covenants (and customary baskets and exceptions with respect\\nthereto) for a credit facility of this size and type and requires the Company to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest\\nexpense of 3.0 to 1.0 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all\\nrelated covenants and ratios.\\n7.Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\\nThe Company uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage foreign exchange risk related to its ongoing business operations with the primary\\nobjective of reducing earnings and cash flow volatility associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The Company did not use any derivative\\ninstruments prior to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\\nNotional Amount of Derivative Contracts\\nThe net notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments were as follows:\\nAs of December 31,\\n2024 2023\\n(in thousands)\\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\\nForeign exchange contracts\\nCash flow hedges $ 18,508,390 $ 8,783,273 \\nFair value hedges 3,819,817 — \\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\\nForeign exchange contracts 1,432,136 — \\nTotal $ 23,760,343 $ 8,783,273 \\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately $1.0 billion of the Company’s euro–denominated Senior Notes was designated as a hedge of the foreign\\nexchange risk of the Company’s net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries.

The Company has elected to present its derivative assets and\\nliabilities on a gross basis on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nThe Company also enters into collateral security arrangements with its counterparties that require the parties to post cash collateral when certain\\ncontractual thresholds are met. Cash collateral received is presented in “Accrued expenses and other liabilities” representing the Company’s obligation to return\\ncounterparty cash collateral.

Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are\\ntranslated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates. An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and\\nemployment agreements as well as other production related commitments. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the\\nCompany enters into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nCertain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of\\nthe reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of\\nsuch license agreements. The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount. However, the\\nunknown obligations are expected to be significant.\\nLegal Proceedings\\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee\\nrelations, business practices and patent infringement. Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of\\ncomplex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company\\'s view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto\\nunfold. The Company expenses legal fees as incurred. The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been\\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the\\nCompany\\'s operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.\\nThe Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at\\nthis time. The Company\\'s view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.\\nNon-Income Taxes\\nThe Company is routinely under audit by various tax authorities with regard to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits\\nprimarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to our revenue in certain jurisdictions. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from\\nexaminations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.\\nSimilar to other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the Company is involved in a number of matters with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-\\nincome tax assessments. Although the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these matters, there is inherent complexity and uncertainty with respect\\nto these matters, and the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations. The current potential exposure with respect to the various issues with\\nBrazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments is estimated to be approximately $400 million, which is expected to increase over time.\\n56'),\n",

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $16 million, $25 million,\\nand $2 million, respectively, net of interest and penalties in the provision for income taxes. The amount of interest and penalties accrued at December 31, 2024\\nand 2023 was $44 million and $28 million, respectively.\\nThe Company files U.S. Federal, state and foreign tax returns. The Company is currently under examination by the IRS for years 2016 through 2018 and\\nis subject to examination for 2019 through 2023. The Company is also generally subject to examination by various state and foreign jurisdictions for years\\n2017 through 2023. While the Company is in various stages of inquiry and examination with certain taxing authorities and believes that its tax positions will\\nmore likely than not be sustained, it is nonetheless possible that future obligations related to these matters could arise. The Company believes that adequate\\namounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from an examination.\\nGiven the potential outcome of current examinations, it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change\\nwithin the next twelve months. However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible adjustments cannot be made at this time.\\n11.    Employee Benefit Plan\\nThe Company maintains a 401(k) savings plan covering substantially all of its employees. Eligible employees may contribute up to 80% of their annual\\nsalary through payroll deductions, but not more than the statutory limits set by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company matches employee contributions at\\nthe discretion of the Board. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s matching contributions totaled $128 million, $114\\nmillion and $102 million, respectively.\\nMultiemployer Benefit Plans\\nThe Company contributes to various multiemployer defined pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-\\nrepresented employees. The risks of participating in multiemployer pension plans are different from single-employer plans such that (i) contributions made by\\nthe Company to the multiemployer pension plans may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers; (ii) if the Company chooses\\nto stop participating in the multiemployer pension plans, it may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan; and (iii)\\nif a company stops contributing to the multiemployer pension plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may become the obligation of the remaining\\nparticipating employers. The Company also contributes to various other multiemployer benefit plans that provide health and welfare benefits to both active and\\nretired participants. The Company does not participate in any multiemployer benefit plans that are individually significant to the Company.\\nThe following table summarizes the Company's contributions to multiemployer pension and health plans for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023\\nand 2022, respectively:\\n63\"),\n",

The term \"executive officer\" herein shall have the same meaning as the term “officer” as defined under Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities\\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).\\nIt is also Company policy to comply with applicable securities laws concerning trading in Company securities on the Company’s behalf.\\nDefinition of Material Nonpublic Information\\nIt is not possible to define all categories of material information. However, information should be regarded as material if there is a substantial likelihood that it\\nwould be considered important to a reasonable investor in making an investment decision regarding transactions of the Company’s securities. Put another way,\\nthere must be a substantial likelihood that the information would be viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the total mix of\\ninformation available in the market concerning the Company. Either positive or negative information may be material.\\nQuestions concerning whether nonpublic information is material can be directed to the Compliance Officer.\\nCovered Parties\\nThe Policy covers executive officers, directors and all employees of, or consultants or contractors to, the Company or its subsidiaries, as well as their\\nimmediate family members who reside with them, anyone else who lives in their household, and any other individuals who do not live in their household but\\nwhose transactions in Company securities are directed by them or are subject to their influence or control (such as parents or children who consult with them\\nbefore trading in Company securities) (“Insiders”). This Policy applies to trades of Company securities in which an Insider has any “beneficial” or other\\ninterest, or over which they exercise investment control.\\nCovered Transactions\\nThis Policy applies to all transactions in the Company’s securities, including common stock, options for common stock and any other securities the Company\\nmay issue from time to time, such as preferred stock, warrants and convertible debentures, as well as to derivative securities relating to the Company’s\\nsecurities, whether or not issued by the Company, such as publicly-traded options. Transactions subject to this Policy include purchases, sales and bona fide\\ngifts of the Company’s securities (which may include gifts to trusts for estate planning purposes, as well as donations to a charitable organization).\\n- 1 -'),\n",

Limit orders with\\nbrokers should not extend beyond any Open Window and be cancellable upon an imposition of a black-out period. Employees interested in trading outside of\\nthe Open Window should look into adopting a 10b5-1 trading plan, as described below. Exercising stock options issued pursuant to the Company’s stock option\\nplan, as otherwise permitted under this Policy, is not considered problematic.\\nThe Company’s Trading Window\\nThe Company has determined that all executive officers, directors, and those other persons identified on Attachment 1 (as may be amended from time to time\\nby the Compliance Officer), shall be prohibited from buying, selling or otherwise effecting transactions in any stock or other securities of the Company or\\nderivative securities thereof EXCEPT during the following trading window:\\n- 2 -'),\n",

If a special black-out period is imposed, the\\nCompany will notify affected individuals, who should thereafter not engage in any transaction involving the Company’s securities and should not disclose to\\nothers the fact of such suspension of trading.\\nIt should be noted that even during the Open Window, any person possessing material nonpublic information should not engage in any transactions in the\\nCompany’s securities until the beginning of the trading day following the date of public disclosure of such information, whether or not the Company has\\nrecommended a suspension of trading to that person.\\nPre-Clearance of Trades and Other Transactions\\nAll executive officers and directors of the Company and other persons designated by the Compliance Officer as being subject to pre-clearance requirements\\nmust refrain from trading in or gifting the Company’s securities, even during the Open Window, without first contacting the Company’s Compliance Officer\\nand obtaining pre-clearance to commence trading in the Company’s securities.\\nIn addition, all executive officers and directors are required to comply with Section 16 of the Exchange Act and related rules and regulations, which set forth\\nreporting obligations as well as limitations on “short swing” transactions. The Company is available to assist in filing Section 16 reporting; however, the\\nobligation to comply with Section 16 is personal. Please direct any inquiries concerning compliance to the Compliance Officer. Executive officers and directors\\nwho wish to pledge the Company's stock as collateral after March 4, 2020 must first contact the Company's Compliance Officer to request an exemption and\\npre-clearance to enter into the transaction.\\nAdoption and Effect of 10b5-1 Trading Plans\\nThe Company permits all directors, executive officers and employees to adopt trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act\\n(“10b5-1 trading plans”). A 10b5-1 trading plan must comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 and may only be adopted or amended in an Open Window\\nand when the person adopting the plan is not otherwise in possession of material nonpublic information about the Company, its subsidiaries or its securities. All\\n10b5-1 trading plans must be pre-approved by the Compliance Officer or his delegate. The restrictions on trading set forth in this Policy shall not apply to\\ntrades made pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan. More information concerning trading plans is available from the Compliance Officer.\\nExemptions from this Policy\\nThe exercise of stock options under the Company’s stock option plan with a cash payment of the exercise price is exempt from this Policy, since the other party\\nto these transactions is the Company itself and the price does not vary with the market, but is fixed by the terms of the option agreement, or the Company\\nwithholding a portion of the shares underlying the options to satisfy exercise price or tax withholding requirements.

In\\naddition, Insiders may be liable for improper transactions by any person (commonly referred to as a “tippee”) to whom they have disclosed material nonpublic\\ninformation regarding the Company or its subsidiaries or to whom they have made recommendations or expressed opinions on the basis of such information as\\nto trading in the Company’s securities.\\nIndividual Responsibility\\nEvery executive officer, director and employee, consultant and contractor has the individual responsibility to comply with this Policy, and the applicable laws\\nof their jurisdiction. An Insider may, from time to time, have to forego a proposed transaction in the Company’s securities even if he or she planned to make the\\ntransaction before learning of the material nonpublic information and even though the Insider believes he or she may suffer an economic loss or forego\\nanticipated profit by waiting. Trading in the Company’s securities during the trading window (including with pre-clearance) should not be considered a\\n“safe harbor,” and all directors, executive officers and other persons should use good judgment at all times.\\nCompliance Officer\\n●The Company’s Chief Legal Officer shall serve as the Insider Trading Compliance Officer (the “Compliance Officer”).

We use compensation elements that align our \\nNEOs’ interests with those of stockholders to drive long-term value.  Our NEOs’ compensation is heavily weighted toward \\nperformance-based, “at-risk” variable cash and long-term equity awards, which are earned only if the Company achieves  \\npre-established financial metrics, with caps on maximum payouts.  In recent years, over 90% of our CEO’s and over 45% of \\nour other NEOs’ target pay has been performance-based and at-risk.  Additionally, 100% of our CEO’s equity awards have \\nbeen granted as PSUs.\\nFor Fiscal 2025, in recognition of the increased complexity and scope of executives’ roles and responsibilities, the CC \\nincreased target equity opportunities for all NEOs .  The CC also increased our CEO’s base salary and target variable cash \\nopportunity for the first time in years to align with peers and ensure internal pay equity  with the base salaries of other \\nNEOs , and shifted the mix of performance-based equity towards MY PSUs for our NEOs (excluding our CEO) to give more \\nweight to long-term performance incentives.  To motivate executives, the CC set certain Base Compensation Plan goals \\nsignificantly above strong Fiscal 2024 results and Threshold goals well above our Fiscal 2024 Stretch Compensation Plan.\\nFinancial Performance and Link to Executive Pay\\nAs described in CD&A , a significant portion of our executive pay opportunities are tied to the achievement of financial \\nmeasures that drive business value and contribute to our long-term success.  The table below shows our goals for the \\napplicable periods that were completed at the end of Fiscal 2025 and their impact on our executive pay.\\nPERFORMANCE GOALS\\nVariable Cash Plan SY PSUs MY PSUs\\nFiscal 2025 \\nRevenuePayout as a % \\nof Target \\nOpportunity Fiscal 2025 Non-\\nGAAP Operating \\nIncome (1)Shares Eligible to \\nVest as a % of \\nTarget Opportunity Fiscal 2023 to 2025    \\n3-Year Relative TSRShares Eligible to \\nVest as a % of \\nTarget Opportunity\\nThreshold    . . . . . . . . . $45.0 billion 50% $16.0 billion 50% 25th percentile 25%\\nBase \\nCompensation Plan $90.0 billion 100% $56.0 billion 100% 50th percentile 100%\\nStretch \\nCompensation Plan $110.0 billion 200% $72.0 billionCEO 150% \\nOther NEOs 200%75th percentileCEO 150% \\nOther NEOs 200%\\nPERFORMANCE ACHIEVEMENT AND PAYOUTS\\nVariable Cash Plan SY PSUs MY PSUs\\nPerformance \\nAchievement for \\nPeriod Ended \\nFiscal 2025 (2)      . . . .$130.5 billion \\nrevenue$86.8 billion \\nNon-GAAP Operating Income (1)100th percentile \\n3-year TSR relative to S&P 500\\nPayout as % of \\nTarget \\nOpportunity     . . . . . .200%CEO 150%\\nOther NEOs 200%CEO 150%\\nOther NEOs 200%\\n(1) See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  in CD&A  for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP results.\\n(2) See Performance Metrics and Goals for Executive Compensation in CD&A  for a description and further discussion of revenue, Non-GAAP Operating Income, \\nand 3-year relative TSR.\\nRatification of Selection of PwC as our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for Fiscal 2026 (Proposal 3)\\nWhile not required, we are asking our stockholders to ratify the AC’s selection of PwC as our independent registered \\npublic accounting firm for Fiscal 2026, as we believe it is a matter of good corporate practice.  If our stockholders do not \\nratify the selection, the AC will reconsider the appointment, but may nevertheless retain PwC.

Following deliberation and engagement with \\nstockholders, the Board approved, adopted and declared advisable an amendment and restatement of our Charter to \\nremove the remaining supermajority voting provisions, remove inoperative provisions related to a previously effected \\nforward stock split and the completed declassification of our Board, and implement other non-substantive clarifying \\nchanges, subject to stockholder approval. The full text of the Proposed Charter is included in Appendix A to this proxy \\nstatement, with proposed new text underlined and proposed deletions crossed out.

Our Board is committed to strong corporate governance and has already adopted a balanced right \\nfor stockholders to call a special meeting.

Our longer-tenured directors are familiar with our operations and business areas and have the \\nperspective of overseeing our activities from a variety of economic and competitive environments, which enhances the \\nBoard’s oversight of strategy and risks.  Given the growth of the Company and the breadth of our product offerings, as \\nwell as the increasingly complex macroeconomic and geopolitical factors we face, these experienced directors are a \\nsignificant asset to the Board.  Our newer directors have brought expertise in brand development and cybersecurity, \\nfamiliarity with technology developments at leading academic institutions, and senior management, operating, and \\nfinance experience, all of which are important to supporting NVIDIA as it enters new markets.  Each year, the NCGC and \\nBoard review each director’s individual performance, including the director’s past contributions, outside experiences and \\nactivities, and committee participation, and determine how his or her experience and skills continue to add value to \\nNVIDIA and the Board. \\n17'),\n",

The Board also determined that all members of \\nour AC, CC, and NCGC are independent under applicable Nasdaq listing standards, and that each of Mr. Seawell, Mr. Jones \\nand Ms. Lora of the AC are “audit committee financial experts” as defined under applicable SEC rules.\\nBoard Leadership Structure\\nOur Board ensures that each member has an equal voice in the affairs and the management of NVIDIA by having an \\nindependent Lead Director, rather than a chairperson, which the Board believes best serves our stockholders.  The \\nindependent directors consider the role and designation of the person to serve as Lead Director on an annual basis .  The \\nBoard recognizes that different board leadership structures may be appropriate under different circumstances and its \\nannual review includes consideration of whether having a Lead Director continues to best meet NVIDIA’s evolving needs \\nand serves in the best interest of its stockholders.  \\nOur Board believes its current leadership structure is appropriate because:\\n• The active involvement of each of our independent directors, combined with the qualifications and significant \\nresponsibilities of, and strong oversight by, our Lead Director, provide balance on the Board;  \\n• It promotes independent oversight of our management and affairs;  \\n• It effectively allocates authority, responsibility, and oversight between management and our independent \\ndirectors; and \\n• It provides the right foundation to pursue the Company’s strategic and operational objectives, particularly in light \\nof the evolution of our business and operating environment. \\nOur CEO has primary responsibility for the operational leadership and strategic direction of the Company, and the Lead \\nDirector facilitates our Board’s independent oversight of management, promotes communication between management \\nand our Board, and supports our Board’s consideration of key governance matters. This arrangement promotes open \\ndialogue among the Board, including discussions of the independent directors during quarterly executive sessions led by \\nour Lead Director, without the presence of our CEO.  We believe that our current structure best serves our stockholders, \\nwithout the need to appoint a person to serve as chairperson of the Board.\\nUnder our Corporate Governance Policies, the Board may select a chairperson in its discretion, but, if it does not, a Lead \\nDirector shall be designated annually by a majority of the independent directors and identified in the Company’s proxy \\nstatement.  These policies help to ensure a robust independent leadership structure on our Board. \\nWhile the Board has discretion to consider other leadership structures, including having the Lead Director (or chairperson, \\nif any) and CEO roles filled by a single individual, it would only consider a change if it best aligned with the interests of our \\nstockholders, management, and the Board, and it complied with applicable laws and regulations.  If in the future our CEO \\nwere to take a leadership position on the Board, such as chairperson, we expect that the Board would continue to appoint \\nan independent Lead Director to maintain a balanced and strong leadership structure and otherwise represent the Board \\nindependently from the Company’s management team.  Any changes to the Board’s leadership structure would take into \\naccount stockholder views, including through our ongoing stockholder outreach, and would be communicated to \\nstockholders on our Investor Relations website and in our proxy statement. Our Lead Director may provide input on the \\ndesign of the Board as requested by the NCGC.  In his role as NCGC Chairperson, our Lead Director will continue to lead \\ndiscussions, provide input, and oversee the design of the Board itself.\\nOur Lead Director\\nStephen C.

Our structure ensures that many senior managers work directly with our \\nCEO to execute our corporate strategies.  This approach results in strategic alignment, exposes leaders to a broad \\nspectrum of corporate activities, and presents the Board with a pool of excellent candidates for future promotion. Our \\nCEO also selects senior leaders to engage directly with the Board on key initiatives and provides periodic updates to our \\nBoard on management development.\\nOutside Advisors\\nThe Board and each of its principal committees may retain outside advisors and consultants of their choosing at our \\nexpense.

More information can be found \\non the Corporate Sustainability section of our website and in our annual Sustainability Report.  Information contained on \\nour website or in our annual Sustainability Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file \\nwith the SEC.  Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Form 10-K for a discussion of risks and uncertainties we face related \\nto CS.\\nClimate and Efficiency\\nWe assess our carbon footprint across our product lifecycle and assess climate risks, including current and emerging \\nregulations and market impacts.  Improving performance and energy efficiency is a principal goal in each step of our \\nresearch, development, and design processes, and our product-level environmental assessments confirm that continuing \\nto enhance the energy efficiency of our products is the most impactful sustainability initiative our company can pursue.  \\nNVIDIA GPUs powered 8 of the top 10 systems on the November 2024 Green500 list, including the top super computer.  \\nOur Earth-2 initiative aims to harness AI and high-performance computing to unlock the potential of vast quantities of \\nclimate data to inform decision-making.\\nWe commit to the following greenhouse gas emissions, or GHG emissions, reduction goals: \\n• Scope 1 and 2: In our upcoming Sustainability Report for Fiscal 2025, we plan to announce that we achieved and \\nwill maintain 100% renewable electricity for offices and data centers under our operational control.  By delivering \\non this commitment, we continue to aim to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with prevalent climate \\nscience standards.  \\n• Scope 3: By the end of Fiscal 2026, we expect to engage manufacturing suppliers comprising at least 67% of \\nNVIDIA’s scope 3 category 1 GHG emissions, with the goal of effecting supplier adoption of science-based \\ntargets. \\nHuman Capital Management\\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest asset, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our \\nstakeholders.  The CC provides oversight of the Company’s human capital management, including policies and strategies \\nrelating to human capital management. \\nTo execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain the very best talent globally, including \\nexceptional executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.\\nRecruitment\\nAs the demand for global technical talent remains high, we have grown our technical workforce and have successfully \\nattracted top talent to NVIDIA.  We have attracted talent worldwide through our strong employer brand and \\ndifferentiated hiring strategies for college, professional, and leadership talent.  Our workforce is 82% technical and 51% \\nhold advanced degrees.  Additionally, we have increased our focus on diversity recruiting, and we welcome employees of \\nall backgrounds. Our own employees help to surface top talent, with over 41% of our new hires in Fiscal 2025 coming \\nfrom employee referrals.\\nDevelopment and Retention\\nTo support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training courses, targeted \\ndevelopment programs, mentoring and peer coaching and ongoing feedback. We constantly upgrade our learning \\nofferings to ensure that our employees are exposed to the most current content and technologies available. We offer \\n35'),\n",

We have also implemented specifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and \\nemployees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread readiness for future advancement.\\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party \\nplatform.  We want NVIDIA to be a place where people can build their careers over their lifetime.  Our employees tend to \\ncome and stay.  In Fiscal 2025, our overall turnover rate was 2.5%.\\nCompensation, Benefits, and Well-Being\\nOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s \\nfuture. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock \\nprice and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our stockholders.\\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being, and financial \\nhealth.  Programs include 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory and supplemental pension programs outside the U.S., our \\nemployee stock purchase program, flexible work hours, and time off policies. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally \\nand aim to provide comparable support across the regions where we operate. We offer tailored benefits based on the \\nneeds of our employees, including continuing support for parents, both new birth parents and those who wish to become \\nparents.\\nDiversity, Inclusion, and Belonging at NVIDIA\\nWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all our \\nemployees.\\nWhen recruiting new talent or developing our current employees, we strive to build a diverse talent pipeline that includes \\nthose underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino \\ncandidates.\\nTo this end we:\\n• Hire, promote and compensate our employees based on merit;\\n• Partner with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities;\\n• Enlist dedicated recruiting teams to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the interview process and \\nidentify internal opportunities;\\n• Support the development and growth of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of \\nfuture leaders;\\n• Provide peer support and executive sponsors for our internal community resource groups;\\n• Provide training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments that allow all our \\nemployees to excel;\\n• Track equity and parity in retention, promotions, pay, and employee feedback; and\\n• Measure year over year progress and provide leadership visibility on talent and diversity efforts.\\nAs of the end of Fiscal 2025, our global workforce was 78% male, 21% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of our \\nworkforce in the United States composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.\\nWe strive to provide equitable compensation and opportunities for advancement to all employees and to achieve \\npromotion parity based on a variety of considerations. \\nFlexible Working Environment\\nWe support a flexible work environment, allowing us to recruit the very best employees, regardless of where they live.   \\nThis flexibility supports diverse hiring, retention of talent, including working parents and other caregivers and employee \\nengagement, which we believe makes NVIDIA a great place to work.\\nWe also provide company-wide designated time off each quarter for employees to rest, recharge and manage personal \\nand family responsibilities.  \\n36'),\n",

Since adopting the RBA Code of Conduct in 2007 when we first became an RBA member, we have \\ncontinued to integrate its elements into our processes, including auditing strategic suppliers and conducting internal \\nassessments to confirm that we are addressing all aspects of responsible supply chain management.  All of our \\nmanufacturing suppliers are expected to comply with the RBA Code of Conduct and associated NVIDIA policies, including \\nan Agreement for Manufacturer Environmental Compliance.\\nWe expect our suppliers to maintain progressive employment, environmental, health, safety, and ethical practices that \\nmeet or exceed applicable laws, the RBA Code of Conduct, our Code of Conduct, and our Human Rights Policy.  We also \\nencourage suppliers to use the RBA Code of Conduct as a platform to go above and beyond compliance.  We monitor our \\nsupply chain through Validated Assessment Program audits and work directly with suppliers to implement any corrective \\nactions. \\nOur goal is to use only conflict-free gold, tantalum, tungsten, and tin (3TG) in our products and to achieve 100% \\nResponsible Minerals Assurance Process-compliant 3TG processing facilities, as explained in more detail in our \\nResponsible Minerals Policy.\\nHuman Rights\\nWe define human rights as the fundamental rights, freedoms, and standards of treatment belonging to all humans.  We \\nfollow the laws of the countries in which we operate, and endorse internationally recognized principles, including the \\nUnited Nations Global Compact, the United Nations Guiding Principles, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the \\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, \\nthe Core Conventions of the International Labour Organization, and the International Labour Organization Declaration on \\nFundamental Principles and Rights at Work.\\nWe have codified our approach to human rights in our Human Rights Policy and work to embed human rights \\nconsiderations into decision-making processes throughout the Company.\\nIn Fiscal 2025, we ran a human rights impact assessment (HRIA) aligned with the UN Declaration on Business and Human \\nRights.  The HRIA covered our value chain and was performed by an independent firm with deep expertise in human \\nrights.  We expect to use the results of the HRIA to inform our human rights strategy and our Human Rights Policy going \\nforward. \\nTrustworthy AI\\nOur artificial intelligence, or AI, principles, which we share with customers and partners, reflect our core values and our \\nCode of Conduct.  We endeavor to deliver trustworthy AI models that comply with privacy and data protection laws, \\nperform safely and as intended, provide transparency about a model’s design and limitations, minimize unwanted bias, \\nand give equal opportunity to benefit from AI.  \\nOur products are programmable and non-specific in nature.  When we provide tools to help developers create applications \\nfor specific industries, we focus on creating products and services that enable developers to create and accelerate \\nsocially beneficial applications.\\nPublic Policy Engagement and Accountability \\nOur NCGC oversees and periodically reviews our public policy engagement and accountability.  Our Government Relations \\nteam engages in the public policy process to advance the long-term interests of the Company and its stockholders, \\nincluding in areas relevant to our operations, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, global trade, research and \\ndevelopment, workforce and energy.

We do not pay additional fees for serving as Lead Director, as chairperson or member of our \\ncommittees, or for meeting attendance.  Directors who are also employees do not receive compensation for service on \\nthe Board. \\nRoles of the Board, the CC, and Compensation Consultant\\nThe CC reviews our director compensation annually with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant, who \\nprovides peer group data and insights on compensation trends and best practices.  The CC engaged Exequity LLP as its \\nindependent compensation consultant to advise on director compensation for the year following our 2024 Meeting, or \\nthe 2024 Program.  The CC recommended the 2024 Program as described below, which the Board approved in December \\n2023.\\nAfterwards, our compensation advisor from Exequity retired, and in September 2024, the CC engaged Semler Brossy to \\nserve as its independent compensation consultant.\\n2024 Program\\nThe 2024 Program maintained the same target compensation as the previous year with a total value of $340,000—slightly \\nbelow the median paid to peer group non-employee directors (based on the peer group determined in late 2023): \\n(1) Target annual value of RSUs granted on the day following our 2024 Meeting, or the 2024 Program RSUs.  50% of the 2024 Program RSUs vested on the \\nthird Wednesday in November 2024 and 50% will vest on the third Wednesday in May 2025, subject to the director’s continuous service.  \\nThe number of shares subject to each director’s 2024 Program RSUs equaled the target value of the grant divided by the \\n30-calendar day trailing average closing price of our common stock that ended the business day before the 2024 \\nMeeting, to smooth the effects of  market volatility.  \\nNew Director Compensation\\nIn connection with Dr. Ochoa's appointment to the Board in November 2024, she received a prorated annual cash retainer \\nand two RSU grants. She was awarded an initial RSU grant with a target value of $255,000, or the Initial Ochoa RSU, and a \\nprorated 2024 Program RSU reflecting her service until the 2025 Meeting, or the Prorated Ochoa RSU. The number of \\nshares subject to the Initial Ochoa RSU was calculated in the same manner as the 2024 Program RSUs, but using the 30-\\ncalendar day trailing average closing price that ended the business day before her appointment. \\nDeferred Compensation Program\\nNon-employee directors can elect to defer the settlement of RSUs upon vesting for tax planning purposes.  Deferrals can \\nbe made to the earlier of (i) the third Wednesday of March of a future year (no sooner than 2026 for the 2024 Program \\nRSUs and Prorated Ochoa RSU, or 2028 for the Initial Ochoa RSU) or (ii) the director’s cessation of service or certain \\nchange-in-control events, in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.   \\nOther Compensation/Benefits\\nOur directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in attending Board and committee meetings, and continuing \\neducational programs.  We do not offer change-in-control benefits to directors, except for vesting acceleration under our \\nequity plans that applies to all plan award holders if an acquirer does not assume or substitute those awards, provided \\nthat the award holder’s continuous service with us has not terminated prior to the change-in-control.  If a director’s \\nservice terminates due to death, their RSU grants will immediately vest in full.  \\nDirectors do not receive dividends on unvested, or vested but deferred, RSUs.\\n38\"),\n",

Approximately 95% of our CEO’s, and approximately 48% of \\nour other NEOs’, total target pay was dependent on corporate performance. \\nExecutive Pay Heavily Weighted Towards Equity Awards\\nThe vast majority of our NEOs’ total target pay for Fiscal 2025 was comprised of equity awards:\\n• SY PSUs based on annual Non-GAAP Operating Income, vesting over 4 year s,\\n• MY PSUs based on 3-year TSR relative to the S&P 500, vesting over 3 years, and\\n• RSUs vesting over 4 years (for NEOs other than our CEO )\\n(1)   Based on total target pay as approved by the CC, consisting of annual base salary, and, assuming the Company achieves associated performance goals \\nat a Base Compensation Plan level, target payout opportunity under our Variable Cash Plan and target equity opportunities the CC intended to deliver. \\n(2)    Reflects the average total target pay mix for our NEOs other than our CEO.  The total does not sum to 100% due to rounding.  \\nNEOs were also eligible for variable cash awards based on annual revenue, in addition to base salary and other \\ncompensation and benefits.\\nKey Changes for Fiscal 2025\\n• CEO Cash Compensation Adjustments : increased base salary and variable cash opportunity to align with peers \\nand for internal pay equity, after years without changes\\n• Increased Target Equity Opportunities for All NEOs : increased target equity opportunities in recognition of the \\nexpanding complexity and scope of their roles and responsibilities\\n• Equity Mix Shift for NEOs Other than CEO : adjusted allocation of target equity across RSUs, SY PSUs, and MY \\nPSUs for NEOs other than Mr. Huang from 40%, 55%, and 5% in Fiscal 2024 to 50%, 25%, and 25% in Fiscal 2025, \\nrespectively, to emphasize long-term performance incentives while encouraging retention\\n• Further Increased Rigor of Performance Goals : set Base Compensation Plan for target variable cash and SY PSU \\nopportunities well above strong Fiscal 2024 results, and set Threshold goals well above Fiscal 2024 Stretch \\nCompensation Plan, to motivate executives\\nRecord Performance Resulting in Maximum Payouts\\nFiscal 2025 RevenueFiscal 2025 Non-GAAP Operating \\nIncome (1)3-Year TSR Relative to S&P 500 \\n(Fiscal 2023 to 2025) (2)\\n$130.5 billion $86.8 billion 384% (100th Percentile of S&P 500)\\n(1)    See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures  below for a reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and GAAP results.\\n(2)   Represents TSR for purposes of the MY PSU performance goal, calculated using cumulative stock price appreciation with dividends reinvested and the \\naverage closing stock price for the 60 trading days preceding the start, and preceding and including the last day, of the 3-year performance period.\\nAs a result of the above performance achievements, each exceeding the CC’s pre-established Stretch Compensation Plan \\ngoals, our NEOs earned the maximum payouts possible for our Fiscal 2025 Variable Cash Plan, SY PSUs granted in Fiscal \\n2025, and MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2023.\\n44'),\n",

Our CC analyzed whether Exequity’s role raised any \\nconflict of interests, taking into consideration the following:  \\n• Exequity did not provide any services directly to NVIDIA (although we paid Exequity on the CC’s behalf);\\n• The percentage of Exequity’s total revenue resulting from fees paid by us on the CC’s behalf;\\n• Exequity’s conflict of interest policies and procedures;\\n• Any business or personal relationship between Exequity and an executive officer , or between Exequity’s individual \\ncompensation advisors and an executive officer or any member of our CC; and \\n• Any NVIDIA stock owned by Exequity or its individual compensation advisors.\\nAfter considering these factors, our CC determined that Exequity’s work did not create any conflict of interests.\\nOur CC reviews and approves all NEO compensation decisions, with input from Mr. Huang and Exequity.  At the CC’s \\ndirection, Exequity and management recommended a peer group for our Fiscal 2025 executive pay program, which the CC \\napproved.

The CC \\nconsidered Exequity’s advice, Mr. Huang’s recommendations, and management’s proposed Fiscal 2025 performance goals \\nthat were informed by the Company’s operating plan, before making its final decisions on Fiscal 2025 NEO compensation.  \\nThe CC certified compensation payouts for performance periods that concluded at the end of Fiscal 2025 under the \\nVariable Cash Plan and for SY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2025 and MY PSUs granted in Fiscal 2023.  The CC also oversaw \\nmanagement’s Fiscal 2025 compensation risk analysis.\\nSubsequent to the determination of our Fiscal 2025 executive compensation program, our compensation advisor from \\nExequity retired.

We also provide limited perquisites to our NEOs from time to time.  See Other Compensation and \\nBenefits below for more information.\\nPay Mix Considerations\\nFor Fiscal 2025, the CC decided that cash compensation would remain constant (other than for Mr. Huang, whose salary \\nand target variable cash had not been adjusted in years) and that the largest portion of NEOs’ total target pay would \\nremain in the form of at-risk equity.  The CC believes an emphasis on long-term, at-risk opportunities drives results and \\nincreases NEO and stockholder alignment, while providing sufficient annual cash compensation to be competitive  and \\nretain our NEOs.  PSUs and RSUs provide long-term incentives and retention benefits as PSUs require achieving \\npredetermined performance goals, and both PSUs and RSUs require longer service (3 years for MY PSUs and 4 years for \\nSY PSUs and RSUs) to fully vest.\\n48'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'F:\\\\Multi-User Document Search and Conversational Q&A System\\\\data\\\\Nvidia\\\\NVIDIA-2025-Annual-Report.pdf'}, page_content='Given Mr. Huang’s position as CEO, the CC determined that 100% of his equity grants should be at-risk and performance-\\nbased, to tightly align his interests with stockholders.  Consistent with prior years, the CC split his target equity \\nopportunity  evenly between  SY PSUs (aligned with our annual corporate financial performance) and MY PSUs (aligned \\nwith our 3-year relative shareholder return).  For other NEOs, the CC adjusted the equity mix to increase the weighting of \\ntarget MY PSU opportunity to further align NEO and stockholder long-term interests, resulting in 50% of the target \\nequity opportunity granted as RSUs and 50% as PSUs, evenly split between SY and MY PSUs.  The CC determined this \\nstructure balanced performance over short- and long-time horizons while providing a meaningful amount of time-vesting \\nRSUs as a retention benefit.\\nSetting Executive Compensation Values\\nFor Fiscal 2025, the CC decided that increases to each NEO’s total target pay were appropriate in light of the increasing \\nscope and complexity of their roles and responsibilities, and internal pay equity considerations.\\nThe CC raised Mr. Huang’s total target pay by $7 million to align more closely with the median of peer company CEOs. \\nSpecifically, his base salary increased by 50%, to $1.5 million, which aligned with the 75th percentile of peers.  The CC \\nbelieved this was appropriate in consideration of internal pay equity  with the base salaries of other NEOs and as it \\nrepresented Mr. Huang’s first base salary increase in 10 years.  His target variable cash opportunity remained at 200% of \\nbase salary, increasing to $3 million, which aligned with the median of peers.  Mr. Huang’s target equity opportunity \\nincreased by 25%, to $27.5 million, which aligned slightly above the median of peers . The CC split the target equity \\nincrease evenly between  SY PSUs and MY PSUs to balance short- and long-term performance-based awards.\\nFor other NEOs, the CC similarly adjusted target equity opportunities by $3 to $3.5 million, in recognition of the growing \\nscope and complexity of their roles, while maintaining internal pay equity. \\nDetermining Equity Award Amounts\\nTo determine the actual number of RSUs and target numbers of SY PSUs and MY PSUs awarded to our NEOs, the CC \\ndivided the value of the target equity they intended to deliver by the 30-calendar day trailing average closing price of our \\ncommon stock ending on the last day of the calendar month prior to the date of grant.  They used this methodology \\ninstead of calculating based on the stock price on the grant date to smooth the effects of  possible market volatility.  The \\nCC understands that using a historical average stock price can cause the ASC 718 grant date value of an award, as \\nrequired to be reported in the Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table, to be different than \\nthe target equity opportunity.  The CC considered various approaches to granting awards and determined the process \\ndescribed above is appropriate.\\nThe target number of SY PSUs would become eligible to vest if the Company achieved Fiscal 2025 Non-GAAP Operating \\nIncome at Base Compensation Plan.  If the Company achieved Fiscal 2025 Non-GAAP Operating Income at Stretch \\nCompensation Plan or more, the maximum SY PSUs eligible to vest would be capped at 150% of Mr. Huang’s SY PSU \\ntarget equity opportunity and at 200% for other NEOs.  If the Company achieved Fiscal 2025 Non-GAAP Operating \\nIncome at Threshold, the minimum SY PSUs eligible to vest would be 50% of each NEO’s SY PSU target equity \\nopportunity.\\nThe target number of MY PSUs would become eligible to vest if the Company achieved TSR relative to the S&P 500 from \\nthe start of Fiscal 2025 to the end of Fiscal 2027, or the 3-Year Relative TSR, at Base Compensation Plan.  If the Company \\nachieved 3-Year Relative TSR at Stretch Compensation  Plan or more, the maximum MY PSUs eligible to vest would be \\ncapped at 150% of Mr. Huang’s MY PSU target equity opportunity and at 200% for other NEOs.  If the Company achieved \\n3-Year Relative TSR at Threshold, the minimum MY PSUs eligible to vest would be 25% of each NEO’s MY PSU target \\nequity opportunity.\\nThe CC capped the payout for Mr. Huang’s SY PSUs and MY PSUs at 150% of his target equity opportunity instead of \\n200% that applied to other NEOs because all of his Fiscal 2025 equity compensation was performance-based.  With these \\ncaps, Mr. Huang would have the same total upside opportunity on his equity awards as the other NEOs, who had 50% of \\ntotal equity opportunity granted as RSUs that vest based solely on continued service and therefore did not have the same \\nupside opportunity.\\n49'),\n",

When evaluating potential perquisites, we consider many factors, including the cost relative to the anticipated \\nbusiness benefit, perceived value to our executives, peer data, as well as corporate governance considerations.\\nWe also provide medical, vision, dental, and accidental death and disability insurance, matches for health savings account \\ncontributions, as well as paid time off and holidays, for our NEOs on the same basis as our other employees.  Our NEOs \\nmay participate, also on the same basis as our other employees, in our ESPP (unless prohibited by Internal Revenue \\nService rules) and our 401(k) plan, which included a Company match of up to $11,500 for 2024 and 2025.   For Fiscal 2025 \\n(which consisted of most of 2024 and a portion of 2025), our NEOs received the following 401(k) matches:  $13,042 for \\nMr. Huang, $14,000 for each of Ms. Kress and Mr. Teter, and $11,500 for each of Mr. Puri and Ms. Shoquist .  We believe \\nthese benefits are consistent with those offered by peers competing for executive talent.  In Fiscal 2025, w e did not \\nprovide any other perquisites or other personal benefits to our NEOs.\\nEquity Grant Timing Practices\\nThe CC approves all equity award grants to our executive officers on or before the grant date.  Typically, the CC \\ncompletes its annual executive compensation review, sets performance goals and target compensation, and grants equity \\nawards in March .  This process is described in How We Determine Executive Compensation above .  On occasion, the CC \\nmay grant equity awards outside of our annual cycle for new hires, promotions, recognition, retention or other purposes.  \\nWhile the CC has discretionary authority to approve such awards, it  does not have a practice or policy of granting equity \\nawards in anticipation of the release of material non-public information. In Fiscal 2025, we did not tim e the release of \\nmaterial non-public information in coordination with equity award grants in a manner that intentionally benefits the value \\nof our executive compensation.\\nStock Ownership Guidelines\\nThe Board believes that executive officers should hold a significant equity interest in NVIDIA. Since June 2024, our \\nCorporate Governance Policies require the CEO to hold shares valued at ten times his base salary, and our other NEOs to \\nhold shares valued at three times their respective base salaries.  Shares that count toward the ownership guidelines \\ninclude those held directly by the NEO, in trust for the NEO or immediate family, and vested but deferred shares, but not \\nunvested equity awards.  NEOs have up to five years from appointment to reach their ownership threshold.  These \\n53'),\n",

Each NEO currently exceeds the stock \\nownership requirements. \\nCompensation Recovery Policy\\nWe have maintained a Compensation Recovery Policy since 2009, and amended it in 2023 to comply with Nasdaq’s listing \\nstandards. Our policy requires the Company to recover certain incentive compensation from current or former executive \\nofficers in connection with certain restatements of financial statements, if the compensation exceeds the amount that \\nthe officers would have received based on the restated financial statements, subject to limited exceptions. \\nTax and Accounting Implications\\nUnder Section 162(m), compensation paid to each of the Company’s “covered employees” that exceeds $1 million per year \\nis generally non-deductible. The CC considers various factors when making its decisions and retains flexibility to provide \\nnon-deductible compensation if consistent with the Company’s executive compensation program goals and the best \\ninterests of the Company and its stockholders.  The CC may also modify compensation that was initially intended to be \\nexempt from the deduction limit if the modifications are consistent with the Company’s business needs.  The CC also \\nconsiders the impact of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code and strives to avoid possible adverse tax \\nconsequences.\\nAdditionally, under ASC 718, the Company records  share-based compensation expense for equity compensation over the \\nvesting period of the award.\\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\nA reconciliation between our GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating income is as follows (in millions):\\nFiscal 2025 Fiscal 2024\\nGAAP operating income       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $81,453 $32,972\\nStock-based compensation expense      . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,737 3,549\\nAcquisition-related and other costs      . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 602 583\\nOther       . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

John Chevedden has notified us of his intent to present the following proposal at the 2025 Meeting. \\nStockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement \\nProposal 5 – Special Shareholder Meeting Improvement \\nShareholders ask our Board of Directors to take the steps necessary to remove the current provision that considers the \\nvoice of certain NVDA shareholders as non-shareholders. Currently all NVDA shares held for less than one continuous year \\nare considered non-shareholders if they seek to call for a special shareholder meeting on an important matter. \\nThe current exclusion of all NVDA shares held for less than one continuous year makes the current so-called shareholder \\nright to call for a special shareholder meeting useless. There is no point to have a useless right on the books of NVDA. \\nThe reason to enable all shareholders to call for a special shareholder meeting is to allow one shareholder or a group of \\nshareholders to quickly acquire NVDA shares to equal the challenging 15% share ownership requirement, based on all \\nshares outstanding, to call for a special shareholder meeting to incentivize a turnaround of NVDA should NVDA find itself \\nin a slump in the future. \\nThe best strategies for turning around a company do not necessarily come from a company’s existing shareholders. \\nIf NVDA finds itself in a future slump, NVDA shareholders and potential NVDA shareholders will not even consider \\nacquiring more shares in order to call for a special shareholder meeting, if they have to wait one-year to call for a special \\nshareholder meeting. A one-year holding period makes no sense. A slumping stock price demands an immediate response. \\nThe fact that one shareholder or a group of shareholders can quickly acquire more shares to call for a special shareholder \\nmeeting is an incentive for NVDA Directors to avoid a slump in the first place since the continued service of the least \\nqualified NVDA Directors could be terminated by a special shareholder meeting. This is a good incentive for the NVDA \\nDirectors to have for the benefit of all NVDA shareholders. \\nAt minimum this proposal alerts shareholders to the severe limitation, to the point of uselessness, baked into the current \\nNVDA rules for shareholders to call for a special shareholder meeting. \\nPlease vote yes: \\nSpecial Shareholder Meeting Improvement – Proposal 5 \\n69'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'F:\\\\Multi-User Document Search and Conversational Q&A System\\\\data\\\\Nvidia\\\\NVIDIA-2025-Annual-Report.pdf'}, page_content='Opposing Statement of the Board \\nOur Board recommends a vote AGAINST  Proposal 5 because it believes it is unnecessary and not in the best interests of \\nNVIDIA and our stockholders.  \\nWe already provide a meaningful and balanced special meeting right. \\nOur Board recognizes the importance of allowing stockholders to call special meetings when needed. In 2024, we \\namended our Bylaws to let stockholders owning at least 15% of our shares for a minimum of one year request a special \\nmeeting. Since then, we’ve engaged with many of our largest stockholders and none raised concerns about the one-year \\nholding period. Removing this requirement could allow a minority of stockholders who have not held a financial stake in \\nNVIDIA for a meaningful period of time to call special meetings and waste NVIDIA’s resources, ultimately harming our \\nstockholders. The current special meeting right strikes a balance between enabling urgent action and protecting NVIDIA \\nand its stockholders from narrow, short-term interests.  \\nSpecial meetings demand substantial time, effort, and management resources, and our one-year holding period is a \\nreasonable safeguard. \\nGiven NVIDIA’s scale and broad stockholder base, calling a special meeting entails significant resource commitments. The \\nassociated legal, administrative and voting processes are time intensive and divert the Board and management from core \\nbusiness operations, potentially impacting stockholder value. Therefore, the Board believes special meetings should be \\nlimited to urgent, extraordinary matters initiated by stockholders with a substantial, long-term financial interest in the \\ncompany. \\nThe one-year holding period is consistent with the SEC’s minimum for stockholders to include a proposal in our proxy \\nstatement. \\nSEC Rule 14a-8 permits stockholders to include proposals in a company’s proxy statement after holding shares for at \\nleast one year, reflecting the principle that proponents should have an economic stake for a meaningful time period \\nbefore using company and stockholder resources. This same rationale underpins our one-year holding requirement for \\nrequesting special meetings. Moreover, under Rule 14a-8, stockholders with minimal holdings may still submit proposals \\nfor annual meetings. \\nWe are committed to strong governance and stockholder accountability. \\nThe Board is committed to best practices and regularly updates its policies based on evolving standards and stockholder \\ninput. These efforts, along with the right to call special meetings, reflect our commitment to effective oversight and \\nengagement: \\n• Active Stockholder Engagement.  We engage stockholders year-round on governance, sustainability, risk \\noversight, and compensation. \\n• Annual Elections and Majority Voting. Directors are elected annually and must receive majority support under our \\nBylaws.\\n• Meaningful Stockholder Rights.  We offer proxy access, director nomination rights, and do not maintain a \\nstockholder rights plan.\\n• Independent, Refreshed Board.  92% of our directors are independent, including our Lead Director and all \\ncommittee members; and four new directors have joined since 2020.\\n• Responsive Governance Reforms.  Following stockholder approval, we plan to implement the removal of \\nsupermajority voting provisions.\\nOur Board believes the current special meeting right, including the one-year holding requirement, is appropriate. Proposal \\n5 is viewed as unnecessary, potentially disruptive, and not in the best interests of NVIDIA or its stockholders.  \\nRecommendation of the Board \\nOur Board recommends that you vote AGAINST  Proposal 5—Special Shareholder Meeting Improvement. \\n70'),\n",

This stockholder proposal is required to be voted upon at the 2025 Meeting only if properly \\npresented. Our Board opposes adoption of this stockholder proposal and recommends that you vote AGAINST  Proposal \\n6. The New York City Carpenters Pension Fund has notified us of its intent to present the following proposal at the 2025 \\nMeeting. \\nStockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement\\u202f \\nProposal 6 – Director Election Resignation Governance Policy \\nResolved: The shareholders of NVIDIA Corporation (\"Company\") request that the Board adopt a new Director Election \\nResignation Governance Policy (\"Resignation Policy\") provision in its corporate governance principles to address those \\nsituations when one or more incumbent Board nominees fail to receive the required majority vote for re-election. The \\nResignation Policy shall provide that each director upon joining the Board tender an irrevocable resignation conditioned \\non the director\\'s failure to receive the required majority vote support in an uncontested election. The Resignation Policy \\nshall provide that the Board should accept a director\\'s tendered resignation absent its finding of a compelling reason or \\nreasons to reject the resignation, as decided by the Board in the exercise of its business judgment. The Resignation Policy \\nshall further stipulate that if the Board rejects a director\\'s resignation and the director remains on the Board as a \\n\"holdover\" director but is not re-elected at the next annual meeting of shareholders, that such director\\'s second tendered \\nresignation shall be effective ninety days after the vote certification. \\nSupporting Statement: The Resignation Policy sets a new demanding director resignation governance guideline to reflect \\nshareholder voting sentiment in director elections. Delaware corporate law states that each director shall hold office until \\nsuch director\\'s successor is elected and qualified or until such director\\'s earlier resignation or removal. An incumbent \\ndirector who does not receive the required vote for election may continue to serve as a \"holdover\" director. The \\nCompany\\'s current director resignation bylaw requires incumbent directors to tender a resignation if they do not receive \\nthe requisite vote to be re-elected in an uncontested annual election. Directors on the Board\\'s Nominating and Corporate \\nGovernance Committee will then review the tendered resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept or \\nreject it. \\nThe proposed Resignation Guideline Policy sets a more demanding director resignation review process, requiring the \\nBoard to articulate a compelling reason or reasons when it rejects a tendered resignation, thus allowing an unelected \\ndirector to continue to serve. Importantly, the Resignation Policy further establishes that if a \"holdover\" director again \\nfails to be re-elected at the next annual meeting of shareholders, the new resignation is effective ninety days following \\nthe election vote certification. While the Guideline Resignation Policy provides the Board latitude to reject the first \\nresignation of an incumbent director who does not receive majority vote support, it honors the shareholder vote as the \\nfinal word on a \"holdover\" director\\'s second election defeat. \\nShareholder director election voting rights under Delaware corporate law are foundational rights in the governance of \\ncorporations. The majority vote director election standard adopted by the Company gives shareholders voting rights that \\nhave legal effect. It is important that corporate director resignation policies, guidelines and bylaws not undermine \\nshareholder voting rights. The proposed Resignation Policy establishes shareholder voting in director elections as a more \\nconsequential governance right, striking a proper balance between board discretion and shareholder voting rights. \\n71'),\n",

Market standards and stakeholder expectations, however, \\nhave significantly changed around such disclosures. As of April 2024, over 80 percent of the S&P 500 and nearly 50 \\npercent of the Russell 1000 Index companies disclose EEO-1 data, establishing this as best practice in workforce data \\nreporting.1 NVIDIA’s change in practice has furthermore led to it lagging peers in disclosures. In comparison to NVIDIA, \\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Intel, Broadcom, and Qualcomm release EEO-1 data. \\nInvestors need annual disclosure of granular workforce data to determine whether investments in workplace culture and \\ntalent management programs have translated to measurable impacts at various levels of the company. The \\ncomprehensive, consistent, and standardized nature of EEO-1 data disclosure also facilitates comparison across firms. As \\nNVIDIA is required to report EEO-1 data to the federal government, it is able to provide a more complete picture of its \\nworkforce without additional burdens on the company to collect data. \\nWorkplace culture and human capital management programs are critical to a company’s talent attraction and retention \\npipeline, which may affect both social equality and financial performance.2 As You Sow and Whistle Stop Capital reviewed \\nthe workforce diversity of 1,641 companies between 2016-2021, finding statistically significant positive correlations \\nbetween manager diversity and return on equity, return on invested capital, and 10-year revenue growth, among other \\nindicators.3 \\nImplementing more robust reporting via the disclosure of EEO-1 data would provide transparency and insight to \\ninvestors, employees, and stakeholders. Further, comparing the data collected to internal and external standards and \\npeers may enhance talent management, workplace culture strategy, and promote employee retention. Subsequent \\ndisclosures around these activities would enable investors to better understand and assess NVIDIA’s human capital \\nmanagement trends and performance. \\n731 https://diversiq.com/blog/whats-new-this-proxy-season-trends-at-the-halfway-point/\\n2 https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/30/diversity-equity-and-inclusion-are-important-to-workers-survey-shows.html  \\n3 https://www.asyousow.org/report-page/2023-capturing-the-diversity-benefit'),\n",

Consequently, the Board has long \\nsupported NVIDIA’s human capital programs and extensive workforce-related disclosures.  \\nFor example, NVIDIA’s 2024 Sustainability Report contains: \\n• Fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022 workforce data on geographic regions, employee type, age, gender, positions held by \\nwomen, and race/ethnicity (U.S.), disability, and veterans. \\n• Detailed hiring data by age, gender, region, and race/ethnicity (U.S.). \\n• Pay ratios of women to men, Asian to White, Black/African American to White, and Hispanic/Latino to White, \\nalong with annual turnover rate statistics by gender and race/ethnicity (U.S.).  \\n• Expansive discussions of NVIDIA’s workforce initiatives, such as community resource groups, learning and \\ndevelopment programs, employee engagement, mentorship, and our benefits and compensation programs. \\nThe Board is proud of NVIDIA’s human capital accomplishments and the success of our employees in creating long-term \\nvalue for our stakeholders. For example, NVIDIA continues to be among America’s best places to work, ranking fourth on \\nGlassdoor’s list of best employers for 2025. \\nWe believe the requested disclosures are not suited to our business. \\nProposal 7 suggests our reporting is deficient because we have not tailored our workforce disclosure to report on gender \\nand race according to the specific job categories used by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for \\nEEO-1 Component 1 reporting. These nine broadly defined roles, including “first/mid-level officials and managers,” “craft \\nworkers,” “operatives,” and “laborers and helpers,” are generic categories applicable to all business types across the U.S. \\nFor example, the “operative” category includes jobs as diverse as laundry workers, weaving machine operators, bakers, \\nand poultry and fish processing workers. These categories are designed for employers with more than 100 employees and \\nare not suited for describing NVIDIA’s workforce.  Publishing data based on generic categories is uninformative and may \\ncreate confusion regarding our workforce, operations, and human capital practices. \\nOur workforce disclosures are used by our stockholders and other stakeholders as an important tool for understanding \\nour business. We take great care in selecting and preparing the most relevant and useful data for these audiences. The \\nBoard believes our stockholders are best served by publishing workforce disclosures based on metrics and categories \\nmost relevant to our business and stakeholders, such as the detailed datapoints in our sustainability reports. \\nOur management is well-positioned to determine the most appropriate workforce reporting metrics.  \\nThe Board believes NVIDIA’s management, supported by our Corporate Sustainability team and overseen by the CC and \\nNCGC, as applicable, is best positioned to assess the most appropriate workforce metrics to be published.  \\nIn 2024, NVIDIA launched a Corporate Sustainability Steering Committee of our executives to oversee our Corporate \\nSustainability team and guide our sustainability strategy and program, in collaboration with the Board and NCGC. The \\nCorporate Sustainability team designs and implements NVIDIA’s extensive public disclosures, including NVIDIA’s annual \\nsustainability report, which is guided by leading disclosure frameworks. The Corporate Sustainability team strives to \\nincorporate stockholder feedback and conducts regular outreach to solicit input and provide updates on progress.  \\nGiven management’s awareness of stockholder priorities and understanding of our business and workforce, the Board \\nbelieves Proposal 7’s imposition of potentially misleading reporting requirements is inappropriate and unhelpful to our \\nstockholders and other stakeholders. \\nRecommendation of the Board\\nOur Board recommends that you vote AGAINST  Proposal 7—Workforce Data Reporting. \\n74'),\n",

This corporation is authorized to issue two classes of stock to be designated, respectively, \\n“Common Stock” and “Preferred Stock.” The total number of shares which the corporation is authorized to issue is Eighty \\nBillion Two Million (80,002,000,000) shares. Eighty Billion (80,000,000,000) shares shall be Common Stock, each having a \\npar value of one-tenth of one cent ($.001). Two Million (2,000,000) shares shall be Preferred Stock, each having a par value \\nof one-tenth of one cent ($.001).\\nAt the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock issued as of immediately prior to the Effective Time \\nshall be automatically subdivided and reclassified into ten (10) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable shares of \\nCommon Stock, without any further action by the Corporation or the holder thereof (the “Stock Split”). Each certificate \\nthat immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Common Stock shall thereafter represent that \\nnumber of shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Common Stock represented by such certificate shall have \\nbeen subdivided and reclassified pursuant to the Stock Split.\\nThe Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series. The Board of Directors is \\nhereby authorized, by filing a certificate (a “Preferred Stock Designation”) pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation \\nLaw, to fix or alter from time to time the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series \\nand the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of any wholly unissued series of Preferred Stock, and to establish from \\ntime to time the number of shares constituting any such series or any of them; and to increase or decrease the number \\nof shares of any series subsequent to the issuance of shares of that series, but not below the number of shares of such \\nseries then outstanding. In case the number of shares of any series shall be decreased in accordance with the foregoing \\nsentence, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the \\nresolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series.\\nV.\\nFor the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Ccorporation, and in \\nfurther definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Ccorporation, of its directors and of its stockholders or \\nany class thereof, as the case may be, it is further provided that:\\nA. 1.

The number of directors which shall constitute the whole Board of Directors shall \\nbe fixed exclusively by one or more resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors.\\n2.  Subject to the other provisions of this paragraph, the Board of Directors is and shall \\nremain divided into three classes, with the directors in each class serving for a term expiring at the third  annual meeting \\nof stockholders held after their election.  Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect \\nadditional directors under specified circumstances,  the terms of the members of the Board of Directors shall be as \\nfollows: (i) at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2012, the directors whose terms expire at that meeting or \\nsuch directors' successors shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders to be \\nheld in 2013; (ii) at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2013, the directors whose terms expire at that \\nmeeting or such directors' successors shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of \\nstockholders to be held in 2014; and (iii) at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2014 and at each annual \\nmeeting of stockholders thereafter, all  directors shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next annual \\nmeeting of stockholders.

Business\\nOur Company\\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. NVIDIA is now a \\nfull-stack computing infrastructure company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry.\\nOur full-stack includes the foundational CUDA programming model that runs on all NVIDIA GPUs, as well as hundreds of \\ndomain-specific software libraries, software development kits, or SDKs, and Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs. \\nThis deep and broad software stack accelerates the performance and eases the deployment of NVIDIA accelerated \\ncomputing for computationally intensive workloads such as artificial intelligence, or AI, model training and inference, data \\nanalytics, scientific computing, and 3D graphics, with vertical-specific optimizations to address industries ranging from \\nhealthcare and telecom to automotive and manufacturing.\\nOur data-center-scale offerings are comprised of compute and networking solutions that can scale to tens of thousands \\nof GPU-accelerated servers interconnected to function as a single giant computer; this type of data center architecture \\nand scale is needed for the development and deployment of modern AI applications.\\nThe GPU was initially used to simulate human imagination, enabling the virtual worlds of video games and films. Today, it \\nalso simulates human intelligence, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical world. Its parallel processing \\ncapabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores, are essential for deep learning algorithms. This form of AI, in \\nwhich software writes itself by learning from large amounts of data, can serve as the brain of computers, robots, and self-\\ndriving cars that can perceive and understand the world. GPU-powered AI solutions are being developed by thousands of \\nenterprises to deliver services and products that would have been immensely difficult or even impossible with traditional \\ncoding. Examples include generative AI, which can create new content such as text, code, images, audio, video, molecule \\nstructures, and recommendation systems, which can recommend highly relevant content such as products, services, \\nmedia, or ads using deep neural networks trained on vast datasets that capture the user's preferences.\\nNVIDIA has a platform strategy, bringing together hardware, systems, software, algorithms, libraries, and services to \\ncreate unique value for the markets we serve. While the computing requirements of these end markets are diverse, we \\naddress them with a unified underlying architecture leveraging our GPUs and networking and software stacks. The \\nprogrammable nature of our architecture allows us to support several multi-billion-dollar end markets with the same \\nunderlying technology by using a variety of software stacks developed either internally or by third-party developers and \\npartners. The large and growing number of developers and installed base across our platforms strengthens our \\necosystem and increases the value of our platform to our customers.\\nInnovation is at our core. We have invested over $58.2 billion in research and development since our inception, yielding \\ninventions that are essential to modern computing. Our invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC \\ngaming market and redefined computer graphics. With our introduction of the CUDA programming model in 2006, we \\nopened the parallel processing capabilities of our GPU to a broad range of compute-intensive applications, paving the way \\nfor the emergence of modern AI. In 2012, the AlexNet neural network, trained on NVIDIA GPUs, won the ImageNet \\ncomputer image recognition competition, marking the “Big Bang” moment of AI. We introduced our first Tensor Core GPU \\nin 2017, built from the ground-up for the new era of AI, and our first autonomous driving system-on-chips, or SoC, in \\n2018. Our acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 expanded our innovation canvas to include networking, enabled our platforms \\nto be data center scale, and led to the introduction of a new processor class – the data processing unit, or DPU. Over the \\npast 5 years, we have built full software stacks that run on top of our GPUs and CUDA to bring AI to the world’s largest \\nindustries, including NVIDIA DRIVE stack for autonomous driving, Clara for healthcare, and Omniverse for industrial \\ndigitalization; and introduced the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software – essentially an operating system for enterprise AI \\napplications. In 2023, we introduced our first data center CPU, Grace, built for giant-scale AI and high performance \\ncomputing, or HPC. With a strong engineering culture, we drive fast, yet harmonized, product and technology innovations \\nin all dimensions of computing including silicon, systems, networking, software and algorithms. More than half of our \\nengineers work on software.\\nThe world’s leading cloud service providers, or CSPs, and consumer internet companies use our data center-scale \\naccelerated computing platforms to enable, accelerate, develop, or enrich the services and offerings they deliver to \\nbillions of end users, including AI solutions and assistants, AI foundation models, search, recommendations, social \\nnetworking, online shopping, live video, and translation.\\nEnterprises and startups across a broad range of industries use our accelerated computing platforms to build new \\ngenerative and agentic AI-enabled products and services, and/or to dramatically accelerate and reduce the costs of their \\nworkloads and workflows. The enterprise software industry uses them for new AI assistants, chatbots, and agents; the \\ntransportation industry for autonomous driving; the healthcare industry for accelerated and computer-aided drug \\ndiscovery; and the financial services industry for customer support and fraud detection.\\n4\"),\n",

Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 \\nas well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities \\nand to China and Country Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To date, we have not received licenses to ship these \\nrestricted products to China. Additionally, we understand that partners and customers have also not received a license to \\nship these restricted products.\\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance \\nperiod, the IFR will, unless modified, impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export \\nControl Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software \\nand technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs, (including but not \\nlimited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing \\nrequirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or \\ncorresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or performance density.\\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products, \\nand any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, \\nH100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada.\\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future \\nresults may be further harmed, over the long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given the \\nincreasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the \\nexport control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing \\nrequirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to \\nsell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing \\nrequirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including \\nthe Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion IFR. In addition to export controls, the USG may \\nimpose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in \\nwhole or in part in China. For example, the USG is considering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive \\nproducts in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply \\nsolutions for our automotive customers.\\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-\\nPacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative \\nmanufacturing locations and negatively impact our business.

The \\nNominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and discussing \\nwith management our practices related to sustainability and corporate governance. We assess our programs annually in \\nconsideration of stakeholder expectations, market trends, and business risks and opportunities. These issues are \\nimportant for our continued business success and reflect the topics of highest concern to NVIDIA and our stakeholders. \\nThe following section and the Human Capital Management Section below provide an overview of our principles and \\npractices. More information can be found on our website and in our annual Sustainability Report. Information contained \\non our website or in our annual Sustainability Report is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file \\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks and \\nuncertainties we face related to sustainability.\\nClimate Change\\nIn the area of environmental sustainability, we work to address our climate impacts across our product lifecycle and \\nassess related risks, including current and emerging regulations and market impacts.\\nIn May 2024, we published metrics related to our environmental impact for fiscal year 2024. Fiscal year 2025 metrics are \\nexpected to be published in the first half of fiscal year 2026. There has been no material impact to our capital \\nexpenditures, results of operations or competitive position associated with global environmental sustainability \\nregulations, compliance, or costs from sourcing renewable energy. We committed to purchase or generate enough \\nrenewable energy to match 100% of our global electricity usage for offices and data centers under our operational \\ncontrol starting with our fiscal year 2025. In fiscal year 2024, we made progress towards this goal and increased the \\npercentage of our electricity use matched by renewable energy to 76%. By the end of fiscal year 2026, we also aim to \\nengage manufacturing suppliers comprising at least 67% of NVIDIA’s scope 3 category 1 GHG emissions with the goal of \\neffecting supplier adoption of science-based targets.\\nWhether it is creation of technology to power next-generation laptops or designs to support high-performance \\nsupercomputers, improving energy efficiency is important in our research, development, and design processes. GPU-\\naccelerated computing is inherently more energy efficient than traditional computing for many workloads because it is \\noptimized for throughput, performance per watt, and certain AI workloads. We continue to have a strong presence on the \\nGreen500 list of the most energy-efficient systems—we powered 8 of the top 10 most energy efficient systems, \\nincluding the top supercomputer, on the November 2024 Green500 list.\\nWe launched our Earth-2 initiative to create a digital twin of the Earth on NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse platforms. \\nEarth-2 will enable scientists, companies, and policy makers to do ultra-high-resolution predictions of the impact of \\nclimate change and explore mitigation and adaptation strategies.\\nHuman Capital Management\\nWe believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and they play a key role in creating long-term value for our \\nstakeholders. As of the end of fiscal year 2025 , we had approximately 36,000 employees in 38 countries; 27,100 were \\nengaged in research and development and 8,900 were engaged in sales, marketing, operations, and administrative \\npositions. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors assists in the oversight of policies and strategies \\nrelating to human capital management.\\nTo execute our business strategy successfully, we must recruit, develop, and retain the very best talent globally, including \\nexceptional executives, scientists, engineers, and technical and non-technical staff.\\nRecruitment\\nAs the demand for global technical talent continues to be high, we have grown our technical workforce and have been \\nsuccessful in attracting top talent to NVIDIA. We have attracted talent worldwide through our strong employer brand and \\ndifferentiated hiring strategies for college, professional, and leadership talent. Our workforce is 82% technical and 51% \\n11'),\n",

Additionally, we have increased our focus on diversity recruiting and we welcome employees of all \\nbackgrounds. Our own employees also help to surface top talent, with over 41% of our new hires in fiscal year 2025  \\ncoming from employee referrals.\\nDevelopment and Retention\\nTo support employee development, we provide opportunities to learn on-the-job through training courses, targeted \\ndevelopment programs, mentoring and peer coaching and ongoing feedback. We constantly upgrade our learning \\nofferings to ensure that our employees are exposed to the most current content and technologies available. We offer \\ntuition reimbursement programs to subsidize educational programs and advanced certifications and encourage internal \\njob mobility. We have also implemented specifically designed mentoring and development programs for women and \\nemployees from traditionally underrepresented groups to ensure widespread readiness for future advancement.\\nTo evaluate employee sentiment and engagement, we use pulse surveys, a suggestion box, and an anonymous third-party \\nplatform. We want NVIDIA to be a place where people can grow their careers over their lifetime and our employees tend \\nto come and stay. In fiscal year 2025, our overall turnover rate was 2.5%.\\nCompensation, Benefits, and Well-Being\\nOur compensation program rewards performance and is structured to encourage employees to invest in the Company’s \\nfuture. Employees receive equity, except where unavailable due to local regulations, that is tied to the value of our stock \\nprice and vests over time to retain employees while simultaneously aligning their interests with those of our shareholders.\\nWe offer comprehensive benefits to support our employees’ and their families’ physical health, well-being, and financial \\nhealth. Programs include 401(k) programs in the U.S., statutory and supplemental pension programs outside the U.S., our \\nemployee stock purchase program, flexible work hours, and time off policies. We evaluate our benefit offerings globally \\nand aim to provide comparable support across the regions where we operate. We offer tailored benefits based on the \\nneeds of our employees including continuing support for parents; both new birth parents and those who wish to become \\nparents. Our support is enhanced during times of crisis, such as war or economic volatility, to take care of our existing \\nteam of world-class talent and their families.\\nDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NVIDIA\\nWe believe that diverse teams fuel innovation, and we are committed to creating an inclusive culture that supports all our \\nemployees.\\nWhen recruiting new talent or developing our current employees, we strive to build a diverse talent pipeline that includes \\nthose underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino \\ncandidates.\\nTo this end, we:\\n• Hire, promote and compensate our employees based on merit;\\n• Partner with institutions and professional organizations serving historically underrepresented communities;\\n• Enlist dedicated recruiting teams to shepherd underrepresented candidates through the interview process and \\nidentify internal opportunities;\\n• Support the development and growth of women employees through programs aimed at building a pipeline of \\nfuture leaders;\\n• Provide peer support and executive sponsors for our internal community resource groups;\\n• Provide training and education to managers and peers on fostering supportive environments that allow all our \\nemployees to do their best work;\\n• Track equity and parity in retention, promotions, pay, and employee engagement scores; and\\n• Measure year over year progress and provide leadership visibility on talent and diversity efforts.\\nAs of the end of fiscal year 2025, our global workforce was 78% male, 21% female, and 1% not declared, with 6% of our \\nworkforce in the United States composed of Black or African American and Hispanic or Latino employees.\\nFlexible Working Environment\\nWe support a flexible work environment allowing us to recruit the very best employees, regardless of where they live. This \\nflexibility supports diverse hiring, retention of talent, including working parents and other caregivers and employee \\nengagement, which we believe makes NVIDIA a great place to work. We also provide company-wide 2-days off per quarter \\nfor employees to rest and recharge.\\n12'),\n",

If we fail to develop or monetize new products and technologies, or \\nif they do not become widely adopted, our financial results could be adversely affected. Obtaining design wins may \\ninvolve a lengthy process and depends on our ability to anticipate and provide features and functionality that customers \\nwill demand. They also do not guarantee revenue. Failure to obtain a design win may prevent us from obtaining future \\ndesign wins in subsequent generations. We cannot ensure that our products and technologies will provide value to our \\ncustomers and partners. If we fail any of these key success criteria, our financial results may be harmed. \\nWe offer enterprise customers NVIDIA DGX Cloud services, which include cloud-based infrastructure, software and \\nservices for training and deploying AI models. We have partnered with CSPs to host such software and services in their \\ndata centers, and we entered and may continue to enter into multi-year cloud service agreements to support these \\nofferings and our research and development activities. The timing and availability of these cloud services have changed \\nand may continue to shift, impacting our revenue, expenses, and development timelines.

These competitors may be able to \\nacquire market share and/or prevent us from doing so, more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunities in new \\nmarkets and end-user trends, more quickly transition their products, and impinge on our ability to procure sufficient \\nfoundry capacity and scarce input materials during a supply-constrained environment, which could harm our business. \\nSome of our customers have in-house expertise and internal development capabilities similar to some of ours and can use \\nor develop their own solutions to replace those we are providing. For example, others may offer cloud-based services that \\ncompete with our AI cloud service offerings, and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve the \\nscale necessary to meet our business objectives. If we are unable to successfully compete in this environment, demand \\nfor our products, services and technologies could decrease and we may not establish meaningful revenue.\\nRisks Related to Demand, Supply, and Manufacturing\\nLong manufacturing lead times and uncertain supply and component availability, combined with a failure to estimate \\ncustomer demand accurately, has led and could lead to mismatches between supply and demand.\\nWe have long manufacturing lead times and build finished products and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated \\ndemand. In periods of shortages impacting the semiconductor industry and/or limited supply or capacity in our supply \\nchain, the lead times for certain supply may be extended. We have previously experienced and may continue to \\nexperience extended lead times of more than 12 months. To secure future supply and capacity, we have paid premiums, \\nprovided deposits, and entered into long-term supply agreements and capacity commitments, which have increased our \\nproduct costs and this may continue. We may still be unable to secure sufficient commitments for capacity to address \\nour business needs. \\nIf we inaccurately estimate demand, or our customers change orders, as we have experienced in the past, we may not be \\nable to reduce our supply commitments in time, at the same rate, or at all. Significant mismatches between supply and \\ndemand have varied across our market platforms, resulted in both product shortages and excess inventory, significantly \\nharmed our financial results and could reoccur. If we underestimate demand, and our foundry partners and contract \\nmanufacturers are unable to increase production or provide sufficient supply, we may not be able to meet increased \\ncustomer demand in a timely manner, or at all. Our reputation and customer relationships could be damaged and we \\ncould lose revenue and market share. Additionally, since some of our products are part of a complex data center buildout, \\nsupply constraints or availability issues with respect to any one component have had and may have a broader revenue \\nimpact. For example, our ability to sell certain products has been and could be impeded if components necessary for the \\nfinished products are not available from third parties.\\nIf we overestimate demand, or if customers cancel or defer orders or choose to purchase from our competitors, we may \\nnot be able to utilize on-hand inventory or reduce purchase commitments accordingly. We have had to reduce average \\nselling prices, including due to our channel pricing programs, increase prices for certain of our products as a result of our \\nsuppliers’ increase in prices, write down our inventory, incur cancellation penalties, and record impairments, and may have \\nto do so in the future. These impacts would be amplified by our non-cancellable and non-returnable purchase orders \\nplaced in advance of our historical lead times and could be exacerbated if we need to make changes to the design of \\nfuture products. The risk of these impacts has increased and may continue to increase as our purchase obligations and \\nprepaids have grown and are expected to continue to grow and become a greater portion of our total supply. All of these \\nfactors may negatively impact our gross margins and financial results.\\nFactors that have caused and/or could in the future cause us to underestimate or overestimate demand, and impact the \\ntiming and volume of our revenue, include:\\n• changes in product development cycles and time to market;\\n• competing technologies and competitor product releases, announcements or other actions;\\n• changes in business and economic conditions;\\n• sudden or sustained government lockdowns or public health issues;\\n• rapidly changing technology or customer requirements;\\n• the availability of sufficient data center capacity or energy for customers to procure;\\n• new product introductions and transitions resulting in less demand for existing products;\\n• new or unexpected end-use cases;\\n• increase in demand for competitive products;\\n• changes in end-user demand; \\n16'),\n",

Extended lead times may occur if we experience other supply constraints caused by natural disasters, pandemics or \\nother events. In addition, geopolitical tensions, such as those involving Taiwan and China, which comprise a significant \\nportion of our revenue and where we have suppliers, contract manufacturers, and assembly partners who are critical to \\nour supply continuity, could have a material adverse impact on us.\\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand \\nprojections and increasing complexity of our data center products. With these additions, we have also entered and may \\ncontinue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. The \\nincreased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain creates \\nmore complexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our \\nexpanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We \\nhave incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity \\ncommitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our \\nchannel partners prepare to ship and support new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the \\narchitectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive products. The computing industry is \\nexperiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set \\nof AI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we \\nseek to complete new computing solutions each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The \\nincreased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product configurations may magnify the \\nchallenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. \\nQualification time for new products, customers anticipating product transitions, and channel partners reducing channel \\ninventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can reduce, or create volatility in, our revenue. We \\nhave experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures when \\ncustomers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for \\ncurrent and future architecture transitions. Our financial results have been and may in the future be negatively impacted \\nif we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason. The increased frequency and \\ncomplexity of newly introduced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the \\nmagnitude of inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. For example, our gross margins in \\nthe second quarter of fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell \\nmaterial. \\nWe incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may \\nimpact our ability to develop other products or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay \\npurchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new \\nproducts as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed \\nprior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, \\nmay impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.\\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect, which may create volatility in our revenue \\nor supply levels. We may not be able to generate significant revenue from them. Because our products may be used in \\nmultiple use cases and applications, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of \\ngenerative AI models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.\\nThe use of our GPUs for new, mercurial, or trendy applications, has impacted and can impact in the future demand for our \\nproducts, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming \\nGPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum. It is difficult for us to estimate with any \\nreasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of \\n17\"),\n",

Because most of our sales are made on a \\npurchase order basis, our customers can generally cancel, change, or delay product purchase commitments with little \\nnotice to us and without penalty. Our partners or customers may develop their own solutions; our customers may \\npurchase products from our competitors; and our partners may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for \\nwhich they purchase our products, all of which may alter partners’ or customers’ purchasing patterns. Many of our \\nindirect customers often do not purchase directly from us but through multiple OEMs, ODMs, system integrators, \\ndistributors, and other channel partners. For fiscal year 2025, an indirect customer which primarily purchases our \\nproducts through system integrators and distributors, including through Customer B, is estimated to represent 10% or \\nmore of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. If end demand increases or our finished \\ngoods supply availability is concentrated near a quarter end, the system integrators, distributors, and channel partners \\nmay have limited ability to increase their credit, which could impact the timing and amount of our revenue. The loss of any \\nof our large customers, a significant reduction in purchases by them, our inability to sell to a customer due to U.S. or \\nother countries’ trade restrictions, or any difficulties in collecting accounts receivable would likely harm our financial \\ncondition and results of operations.\\nIf we are unable to attract, retain and motivate our executives and key employees, our business may be harmed.\\nTo remain competitive and successfully execute our business strategy, we must attract, retain, and motivate our \\nexecutives and key employees, as well as recruit and develop exceptional and diverse talent. However, labor is subject to \\nexternal factors that are beyond our control, including our industry’s highly competitive market for skilled workers and \\nleaders, and workforce participation rates. Changes in immigration and work permit regulations, or in their administration \\nor interpretation, could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for talent drives up costs \\nin the form of cash and stock-based compensation. In times of stock price volatility, as we have experienced in the past \\nand may experience in the future, the retentive value of our stock-based compensation may decrease. Additionally, we are \\nhighly dependent on the services of our longstanding executive team. Failure to ensure effective succession planning, \\ntransfer of knowledge, and smooth transitions involving executives and key employees could hinder our strategic \\nplanning, execution, and long-term success.\\nOur business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business processes and information systems and \\nmodification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business and internal controls.\\nWe rely upon internal processes and information systems to support key business functions, including our assessment of \\ninternal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The efficient operation \\nand scalability of these processes and systems is critical to support our growth. We continue to design and implement \\nupdated accounting functionality related to a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system. Any ERP system \\nimplementation may introduce problems, such as quality issues or programming errors, that could have an impact on our \\ncontinued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial results. These \\nchanges may be costly and disruptive to our operations and could impose substantial demands on management time. \\nFailure to implement new or updated controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our \\noperating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.\\nIdentification of material weaknesses in our internal controls, even if quickly remediated once disclosed, may cause \\ninvestors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may decline. Remediation of any material \\nweakness could require us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to remediate any material weakness, our financial \\nstatements may be inaccurate, we may be required to restate our financial statements, our ability to report our financial \\nresults on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, our \\nstock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities.\\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate, and if our operating results are \\nbelow the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could decline.\\nOur operating results have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors. Therefore, \\ninvestors should not rely on our past results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Factors that could \\naffect our results of operations include, but are not limited to:\\n• our ability to adjust spending due to the multi-year development cycle for some of our products and services;\\n• our ability to comply with our contractual obligations to customers;\\n24\"),\n",

For example, we have granted and \\nmay continue to grant extended payment terms to some customers, particularly during macroeconomic downturns, \\nwhich could impact our ability to collect payment. Our vendors have requested and may continue to ask for shorter \\npayment terms, which may impact our cash flow generation. These arrangements reduce the cash we have available for \\ngeneral business operations. In addition, the pace of growth in our operating expenses and investments may lag our \\nrevenue growth, creating volatility or periods where profitability levels may not be sustainable. Failure to meet our \\nexpectations or the expectations of our investors or security analysts is likely to cause our stock price to decline, as it has \\nin the past, or substantial price volatility.\\nRisks Related to Regulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters\\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules, regulations, and political and other actions, including restrictions on the export \\nof our products, which may adversely impact our business.\\nWe are subject to laws and regulations domestically and worldwide, affecting our operations in areas including, but not \\nlimited to, IP ownership and infringement; taxes; import and export requirements and tariffs; anti-corruption, including \\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; business acquisitions; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; \\nforeign ownership and investment; data privacy requirements; competition and antitrust; advertising; employment; \\nproduct regulations; cybersecurity; environmental, health, and safety requirements; the responsible use of AI; \\nsustainability; cryptocurrency; and consumer laws. Compliance with such requirements can be onerous and expensive, \\ncould impact our competitive position, and may negatively impact our business operations and ability to manufacture and \\nship our products. There can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, suppliers, customers or agents will not \\nviolate applicable laws or the policies, controls, and procedures that we have designed to help ensure compliance with \\nsuch laws, and violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on \\nthe conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations to which we are \\nsubject, or changes to their interpretation and enforcement, could lead to materially greater compliance and other costs, \\nand/or further restrictions on our ability to manufacture and supply our products and operate our business. For example, \\nwe may face increased compliance costs as a result of changes or increases in antitrust legislation, regulation, \\nadministrative rule making, increased focus from regulators on cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Our position in \\nmarkets relating to AI has led to increased interest in our business from regulators worldwide, including the European \\nUnion, the United States, the United Kingdom, South Korea and China. For example, the French Competition Authority \\ncollected information from us regarding our business and competition in the graphics card and cloud service provider \\nmarket as part of an ongoing inquiry into competition in those markets. We have also received, and continue to receive, \\nbroad requests for information from competition regulators in the European Union, the United States, the United \\nKingdom, China, and South Korea regarding our sales of GPUs and other NVIDIA products, our efforts to allocate supply, \\nfoundation models and our investments, partnerships and other agreements with companies developing foundation \\nmodels, the markets in which we compete and our competition, our strategies, roadmaps, and efforts to develop, market, \\nand sell hardware, software, and system solutions, and our agreements with customers, suppliers, and partners. We \\nexpect to receive additional requests for information in the future. Such requests may be expensive and burdensome and \\ncould negatively impact our business and our relationships with customers, suppliers, and partners.\\nGovernments and regulators are also considering, and in certain cases, have imposed restrictions on the hardware, \\nsoftware, and systems used to develop frontier foundation models and generative AI. For example, the EU AI Act became \\neffective on August 1, 2024 and will be fully applicable after a two-year transitional period. The EU AI Act may impact our \\nability to train, deploy, or release AI models in the EU. Several states are considering enacting or have already enacted \\nregulations concerning AI technologies, which may impact our ability to train, deploy, or release AI models, and increase \\nour compliance costs. Restrictions under these and any other regulations, if implemented, could increase the costs and \\nburdens to us and our customers, delay or halt deployment of new systems using our products, and reduce the number of \\nnew entrants and customers, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Revisions to laws or regulations or \\ntheir interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of or increase \\nto import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have \\nan adverse effect on our business plans or impact the timing of our shipments. Additionally, changes in the public \\nperception of governments in the regions where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and \\nresults of operations.\\nGovernment actions, including trade protection and national and economic security policies of U.S. and foreign \\ngovernment bodies, such as tariffs, import or export regulations, including deemed export restrictions and restrictions on \\n25\"),\n",

If we were ever found to have violated export control laws or sanctions of the U.S. or similar applicable \\nnon-U.S. laws, even if the violation occurred without our knowledge, we may be subject to various penalties available \\nunder the laws, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial \\ncondition.\\nFor example, in response to the war in Ukraine, the United States and other jurisdictions imposed economic sanctions and \\nexport control measures which blocked the passage of our products, services and support into Russia, Belarus, and \\ncertain regions of Ukraine. In fiscal year 2023, we stopped direct sales to Russia and closed business operations in Russia. \\nConcurrently, the war in Ukraine has impacted sales in EMEA and may continue to do so in the future.\\nThe increasing focus on the risks and strategic importance of AI technologies has resulted in regulatory restrictions that \\ntarget products and services capable of enabling or facilitating AI and may in the future result in additional restrictions \\nimpacting some or all of our product and service offerings.\\nConcerns regarding third-party use of AI for purposes contrary to local governmental interests, including concerns \\nrelating to the misuse of AI applications, models, and solutions, has resulted in and could in the future result in unilateral \\nor multilateral restrictions on products that can be used for training, modifying, tuning, and deploying LLMs and other AI \\napplications. Such restrictions have limited and could in the future limit the ability of downstream customers and users \\nworldwide to acquire, deploy and use systems that include our products, software, and services, and negatively impact \\nour business and financial results.\\nSuch restrictions could include additional unilateral or multilateral export controls on certain products or technology, \\nincluding but not limited to AI technologies. As geopolitical tensions have increased, semiconductors associated with AI, \\nincluding GPUs and related products, are increasingly the focus of export control restrictions proposed by stakeholders in \\nthe U.S. and its allies. The United States has imposed unilateral worldwide controls restricting GPUs and associated \\nproducts, and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral controls will be adopted. Such controls have been and \\nmay again be very broad in scope and application, prohibit us from exporting our products to any or all customers in one \\nor more markets, including but not limited to China and over 150 countries designated “Tier 2” by the January 2025 AI \\nDiffusion IFR, and could negatively impact our manufacturing, testing and warehousing locations and options, or could \\nimpose other conditions that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our \\nbusiness, revenue and financial results. Export controls targeting GPUs and semiconductors associated with AI, which \\nhave been imposed and are increasingly likely to be further tightened, would further restrict our ability to export our \\ntechnology, products, or services even though competitors may not be subject to similar restrictions, creating a \\ncompetitive disadvantage for us and negatively impacting our business and financial results. Export controls targeting \\nGPUs and semiconductors associated with AI have subjected and may in the future subject downstream users of our \\nproducts to additional restrictions on the use, resale, repair, or transfer of our products, negatively impacting our \\nbusiness and financial results. Controls could negatively impact our cost and/or ability to provide services such as NVIDIA \\nAI cloud services and could impact the cost and/or ability for our CSPs and customers to provide services to their end \\ncustomers, even outside China.\\nExport controls could disrupt our supply chain and distribution channels, negatively impacting our ability to serve \\ndemand, including in markets outside China and for our gaming products. The possibility of additional export controls has \\nnegatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact demand for our products, benefiting competitors that offer \\nalternatives less likely to be restricted by further controls. Repeated changes in the export control rules are likely to \\nimpose compliance burdens on our business and our customers, negatively and materially impacting our business.\\nIncreasing use of economic sanctions and export controls has impacted and may in the future impact demand for our \\nproducts or services, negatively impacting our business and financial results. Reduced demand due to export controls \\ncould also lead to excess inventory or cause us to incur related supply charges. Additional unilateral or multilateral \\ncontrols are also likely to include deemed export control limitations that negatively impact the ability of our research and \\ndevelopment teams to execute our roadmap or other objectives in a timely manner. Additional export restrictions may not \\nonly impact our ability to serve overseas markets, but also provoke responses from foreign governments, including China, \\nthat negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our products and services to customers in all markets \\nworldwide, which could also substantially reduce our revenue. Regulators in China have inquired about our sales and \\nefforts to supply the China market and our fulfillment of the commitments we entered at the close of our Mellanox \\nacquisition. For example, regulators in China are investigating whether complying with applicable U.S. export controls \\ndiscriminates unfairly against customers in the China market. If regulators conclude that we have failed to fulfill such \\ncommitments or we have violated any applicable law in China, we could be subject to financial penalties, restrictions on \\nour ability to conduct our business, restrictions regarding our networking products and services, or otherwise impact our \\noperations in China, any of which could have a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results and \\nfinancial condition. \\n26'),\n",

These restrictions impact exports of certain chips, as \\nwell as software, hardware, equipment and technology used to develop, produce and manufacture certain chips to China \\n(including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia, and specifically impact our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any \\nother systems or boards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits. The licensing requirements also apply to any \\nfuture NVIDIA integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip-to-chip I/O performance thresholds, as well \\nas any system or board that includes those circuits. There are also now licensing requirements to export a wide array of \\nproducts, including networking products, destined for certain end users and for certain end uses in China. During the \\nsecond quarter of fiscal year 2024, the USG also informed us of an additional licensing requirement for a subset of A100 \\nand H100 products destined to certain customers and other regions, including some countries in the Middle East.\\nIn October 2023, the USG announced new and updated licensing requirements that became effective in our fourth \\nquarter of fiscal year 2024 for exports to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5 (including but not limited to, Saudi \\nArabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Vietnam, but excluding Israel) of our products exceeding certain performance \\nthresholds, including, but not limited to, the A100, A800, H100, H800, L4, L40, L40S and RTX 4090. The licensing \\nrequirements also apply to the export of products exceeding certain performance thresholds to a party headquartered in, \\nor with an ultimate parent headquartered in, Country Group D5, including China. \\nOn October 23, 2023, the USG informed us that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of \\nour A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S products (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell \\nsystems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 as well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require \\na license for any shipment to certain entities and to China and Country Groups D1, D4, and D5, excluding Israel. To date, \\nwe have not received licenses to ship these restricted products to China.\\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance \\nperiod, the IFR will, unless modified, impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export \\nControl Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software \\nand technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs, (including but not \\nlimited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing \\nrequirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or \\ncorresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or performance density.\\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products, \\nand any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, \\nH100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada. \\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would divide the world into three tiers, relegating most countries to “Tier 2” status. The AI Diffusion \\nIFR would confer special benefits on select “Universal Verified End Users”, or UVEU, and lesser benefits on “National \\nVerified End Users”, or NVEU. The AI Diffusion IFR would have numerous effects that may negatively impact our long-term \\nfinancial results and competitive position, including but not limited to the following. \\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would reduce the market for U.S.-designed and manufactured computing products and services, by \\nexpressly limiting exports, reexports, and transfers of covered products to Tier 2 countries and companies in Tier 1 \\ncountries that are either headquartered in Tier 2, or have an ultimate parent headquartered in a Tier 2 country. These \\nrestrictions would apply to all covered products, including products sold years ago.\\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would limit access to the market for IT services and computing infrastructure, by favoring a select \\nnumber of government-approved firms that achieve UVEU status. UVEUs may choose to favor their own accelerators, \\nplatforms, and systems, rather than selecting products based on merit.\\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would encourage our customers to invest in alternatives that are not affected by USG regulations, \\nincluding foreign competition.\\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would increase our and our customers’ costs of doing business, creating compliance challenges and \\nrisks, and impact our supply and distribution chains, which will be subject to new compliance burdens and related \\nextraterritorial regulatory obligations. \\nThe AI Diffusion IFR would expose U.S. providers and the U.S. industry to an enhanced risk of retaliation from other \\ncountries, in the form of tariffs, import/export controls, or other regulatory actions.\\nThe AI Diffusion IFR’s licensing requirement could impact our ability to complete development of products in a timely \\nmanner, support existing customers using covered products, or supply customers with covered products outside the \\nimpacted regions, and may require us to transition certain operations out of one or more of the identified countries.\\n27'),\n",

The USG evaluates license requests in a closed process that does \\nnot have clear standards or an opportunity for review. For example, the Notified Advanced Computing, or “NAC,” process \\nhas not resulted in approvals for exports of products to customers in China. The license process for exports to D1 and D4 \\ncountries has been time-consuming and resulted in license conditions that are onerous, even for small-sized systems that \\nare not able to train frontier AI models.

Even if the USG grants any requested licenses, the licenses may be \\ntemporary or impose burdensome conditions that we or our customers or end users cannot or choose not to fulfill. The \\nlicensing requirements may benefit certain of our competitors, as the licensing process will make our pre-sale and post-\\nsale technical support efforts more cumbersome and less certain and encourage customers in China to pursue \\nalternatives to our products, including semiconductor suppliers based in China, Europe, and Israel.\\nGiven the increasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again \\nchange the export control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and \\nlicensing requirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be \\nunable to sell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the \\nlicensing requirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, \\nincluding the Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion IFR. For example, the USG has already \\nimposed conditions to limit the ability of foreign firms to create and offer as a service large-scale GPU clusters, for \\nexample by imposing license conditions on the use of products to be exported to certain countries, and may impose \\nadditional conditions such as requiring chip tracking and throttling mechanisms that could disable or impair GPUs if \\ncertain events, including unauthorized system configuration, use, or location, are detected. The USG has already imposed \\nexport controls restricting certain gaming GPUs, and if the USG expands such controls to restrict additional gaming \\nproducts, it may disrupt a significant portion of our supply and distribution chain and negatively impact sales of such \\nproducts to markets outside China, including the U.S. and Europe. In addition, as the performance of the gaming GPUs \\nincreases over time, export controls may have a greater impact on our ability to compete in markets subject to those \\ncontrols. Export controls may disrupt our supply and distribution chain for a substantial portion of our products, which \\nare warehoused in and distributed from Hong Kong. Export controls restricting our ability to sell data center GPUs may \\nalso negatively impact demand for our networking products used in servers containing our GPUs. The USG may also \\nimpose export controls on our networking products, such as high-speed network interconnects, to limit the ability of \\ndownstream parties to create large clusters for frontier model training. Any new control that impacts a wider range of \\nour products would likely have a disproportionate impact on NVIDIA and may disadvantage us against certain of our \\ncompetitors that sell chips that are outside the scope of such control. Excessive or shifting export controls have already \\nand may in the future encourage customers outside China and other impacted regions to “design-out” certain U.S. \\nsemiconductors from their products to reduce the compliance burden and risk, and to ensure that they are able to serve \\nmarkets worldwide. Excessive or shifting export controls have already encouraged and may in the future encourage \\noverseas governments to request that our customers purchase from our competitors rather than NVIDIA or other U.S. \\nfirms, harming our business, market position, and financial results. As a result, excessive or shifting export controls may \\nnegatively impact demand for our products and services not only in China, but also in other markets, such as Europe, \\nLatin America, and Southeast Asia. Excessive or shifting export controls increase the risk of investing in U.S. advanced \\nsemiconductor products, because by the time a new product is ready for market, it may be subject to new unilateral \\nexport controls restricting its sale. At the same time, such controls may increase investment in foreign competitors, \\nwhich would be less likely to be restricted by U.S. controls. If additional products are subject to worldwide licensing \\nrequirements, we may incur significant inventory provisions and excess purchase obligation charges.\\nIn addition to export controls, the USG may impose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate \\ntechnologies developed or manufactured in whole or in part in China.

We could be \\nsubject to countersuits as a result. If infringement claims are made against us or our products are found to infringe a \\nthird party’s IP, we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek a license to the third party’s IP rights. If we or one of our \\nindemnitees is unable to obtain such a license on acceptable terms or at all, we could be subject to substantial liabilities \\nor have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our products. We may also have to make \\nroyalty or other payments or cross license our technology. If these arrangements are not concluded on commercially \\nreasonable terms, our business could be negatively impacted. Furthermore, the indemnification of a customer or other \\nindemnitee may increase our operating expenses and negatively impact our operating results.\\nWe rely on patents, trademarks, trade secrets, employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements, licensing \\narrangements and the laws of the countries in which we operate to protect our IP. Foreign laws may not protect our \\nproducts or IP rights to the same extent as United States law. This makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and \\nproducts more likely. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential information \\ncould harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products; as a result, the value of our investment in \\nresearch and development, product development and marketing could be reduced. We also may face risks to our IP if our \\nemployees are hired by competitors. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for existing \\nand new innovations and technologies but cannot be certain whether our applications for such protections will be \\napproved, and, if approved, whether they will be enforceable.\\nWe are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security laws, rules, regulations and other obligations. \\nThese areas could damage our reputation, deter current and potential customers, affect our product design, or result \\nin legal or regulatory proceedings and liability.\\nWe process sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations, \\nindustry standards, external and internal policies, contracts and other obligations that govern the processing of such \\ndata by us and on our behalf. Concerns about our practices or the ultimate use of our products and services with regard \\nto the collection, use, retention, security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, including \\nfor use in AI, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. The theft, loss or \\nmisuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partners could result in damage to our reputation, regulatory \\nproceedings, disruption of our business activities or increased security or remediation costs and costs related to \\ndefending legal claims.\\nIn the United States, federal, state and local authorities have enacted numerous data privacy and security laws, including \\nfor data breach notification, personal data privacy and consumer protection. Numerous U.S. states have enacted \\ncomprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered businesses, including providing specific \\ndisclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights concerning their personal data. As applicable, \\nsuch rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete certain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data \\nprocessing activities, such as targeted advertising, profiling and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights \\nmay impact our business and ability to provide our products and services. Certain states also impose stricter \\nrequirements for processing certain personal data, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy \\nimpact assessments. These state laws allow for statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer \\nPrivacy Act of 2018, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or CPRA, or collectively the CCPA, gives \\nCalifornia residents the right to access, delete and opt-out of certain sharing of their personal information, and to receive \\ndetailed information about how it is used and shared. The CCPA provides for substantial fines for intentional violation and \\nthe law created a private right of action for certain data breaches. Similar laws are being considered in several other \\nstates, as well as at the federal and local levels. Additionally, several states and localities have enacted measures related \\nto the use of AI and machine learning in products and services. If we become subject to additional data privacy laws, the \\nrisk of enforcement action against us could increase. \\nWorldwide regulatory authorities are also considering and have approved various legislative proposals concerning data \\nprotection. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the United Kingdom \\nsimilarly adopted the U.K. GDPR, governing the strict handling of personal data of persons within the European Economic \\nArea, or EEA, and the United Kingdom, respectively, including its use and protection and the ability of persons whose data \\nis stored to access, correct, and delete such data about themselves. If we are found not to comply, we could be subject to \\npenalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is greater, and classes of individuals or consumer \\nprotection organizations may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data. Furthermore, the EU AI \\nAct and similar legislation could impose onerous obligations that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage us and \\nrequire us to change our business practices. Additionally, Europe’s Network and Information Security Directive, or NIS2, \\nregulates resilience and incident response capabilities of entities operating in a number of sectors, including the digital \\ninfrastructure sector. Non-compliance with NIS2 may lead to administrative fines of a maximum of 10 million Euros or up \\nto 2% of the total worldwide revenue of the preceding fiscal year.\\nIn the ordinary course of business, we transfer personal data from Europe, China, and other jurisdictions to the United \\nStates or other countries. Certain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border personal data \\n30'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'F:\\\\Multi-User Document Search and Conversational Q&A System\\\\data\\\\Nvidia\\\\NVIDIA-2025-Annual-Report.pdf'}, page_content='transfer laws. For example, the GDPR governs the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA. The \\nEuropean Commission released a set of “Standard Contractual Clauses” designed for entities to validly transfer personal \\ndata out of the EEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of \\nprotection, including the United States. Additionally, the U.K.’s International Data Transfer Agreement / Addendum, as \\nwell as the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the U.K. extension thereto (which allows for transfers to relevant U.S.-\\nbased organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the Framework) are mechanisms that may be used to \\ntransfer personal data from the EEA and U.K. to the United States. However, these mechanisms are subject to legal \\nchallenges, and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal data to \\nthe United States. Other jurisdictions have enacted or are considering similar cross-border personal data transfer laws \\nand local personal data residency laws, any of which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could \\nresult in fines from regulators. For example, China’s law imposes various requirements relating to data processing and \\ndata localization. Data broadly defined as important under China’s law, including personal data, may not be transferable \\noutside of China without prior assessment and approval by the Cyberspace Administration of China, or CAC. Compliance \\nwith these requirements, including CAC assessments and any deemed failures of such assessments, could cause us to \\nincur liability, prevent us from using data collected in China or impact our ability to transfer data outside of China. The \\ninability to import personal data to the United States could significantly and negatively impact our business operations, \\nlimit our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European, China and other data privacy and security laws, or \\nrequire us to increase our personal data processing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense. Some \\nEuropean regulators have prevented companies from transferring personal data out of Europe for allegedly violating the \\nGDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations, which could negatively impact our business.\\nWe are also bound by certain contractual obligations related to data privacy and security, and our efforts to comply with \\nsuch obligations may not be successful or may be claimed to be non-compliant. For example, certain privacy laws, such as \\nthe GDPR and the CCPA, require our customers to impose specific contractual restrictions on their service providers. We \\nsometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customers, and if a breach exposed or altered that personal data, \\nit could harm those customer relationships and subject us to litigation, regulatory action, or fines. We publish privacy \\npolicies, marketing materials and other statements, such as compliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory \\nprinciples, regarding data privacy and security. Regulators in the U.S. are increasingly scrutinizing these statements, and if \\nthese policies, materials or statements are found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair or \\nmisrepresentative of our practices, we may be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators or other \\nadverse consequences.\\nData protection laws around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly \\nstringent fashion and in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. These obligations may affect our product \\ndesign and necessitate changes to our information technologies, systems and practices and to those of any third parties \\nthat process personal data on our behalf. Despite our efforts, we or third parties we rely upon may fail to comply with \\nsuch obligations. If we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with data privacy and security obligations, \\nwe could face significant consequences, including but not limited to, government enforcement actions, litigation, \\nadditional reporting requirements and/or oversight, bans on processing personal data, and orders to destroy or not use \\npersonal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition.\\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and our operating results may be adversely impacted by changes in \\ntax laws, higher than expected tax rates and other tax-related factors.\\nWe are subject to complex income tax laws and regulations, as well as non-income-based taxes, in various jurisdictions. \\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are \\nregularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, \\nany adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount of non-income taxes imposed \\non our business, and harm our financial position, results of operations, net income, and cash flows.\\nFurther, changes in tax laws or their interpretation by tax authorities in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions could increase our \\nfuture tax liability or cause other adverse tax impacts, which may materially impact our results of operations, or the way \\nwe conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the U.S., with a significant portion qualifying for preferential \\ntreatment as foreign-derived intangible income, or FDII. If U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deduction is reduced, our \\nprovision for income taxes, results of operations, net income, and cash flows would be adversely affected. In addition, our \\ntax obligations and effective tax rate in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business could increase as a result of \\ninternational tax developments, including the implementation of the Two-Pillar framework led by the Organization for \\nEconomic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, which involves the reallocation of taxing rights in respect of certain \\nmultinational enterprises above a fixed profit margin to the jurisdictions in which they carry on business (referred to as \\nPillar One), and imposes a minimum effective corporate tax rate (referred to as Pillar Two). A number of countries in which \\nwe conduct business have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, elements of the Pillar Two rules. Any such tax laws, \\nor changes in any such tax laws may increase tax uncertainty and compliance costs and adversely affect our provision for \\nincome taxes, cash tax payments, results of operations, and financial condition.\\nOur future effective tax rate may also be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in our business or statutory \\nrates, the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, available tax incentives, credits and deductions, \\n31'),\n",

Furthermore, the tax effects of accounting for stock-based compensation and volatility in our stock price \\nmay significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur. A decline in our stock price may result in \\nreduced future tax benefits from stock-based compensation, increase our effective tax rate, and adversely affect our \\nfinancial results.\\nOur business is exposed to the burden and risks associated with litigation, investigations and regulatory proceedings.\\nWe currently and will likely continue to face legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and/or \\ninvestigations involving shareholder, consumer, competition and/or other issues relating to our business. For example, we \\nare defending a securities class action lawsuit from multiple shareholders asserting claims that we and certain of our \\nofficers made false and/or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining \\non GPU demand in 2017 and 2018. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse rulings \\ncould occur, including monetary damages or fines, or an injunction stopping us from manufacturing or selling certain \\nproducts, engaging in certain business practices, or requiring other remedies, such as compulsory licensing of patents. An \\nunfavorable outcome or settlement may result in a material adverse impact. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can be \\ncostly, time-consuming, and disruptive to our operations.\\nDelaware law and our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and agreement with Microsoft could delay or prevent a \\nchange in control.\\nThe anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in \\ncontrol. Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a \\nmajority of our outstanding stock. These provisions include the ability of our Board of Directors to create and issue \\npreferred stock, change the number of directors, and to make, amend or repeal our bylaws without prior shareholder \\napproval; the inability of our shareholders to act by written consent; advance notice requirements for director \\nnominations and shareholder proposals; and super-majority voting requirement to amend some provisions in our \\ncertificate of incorporation and bylaws. Under our agreement with Microsoft for the Xbox, if someone makes an offer to \\npurchase at least 30% of our outstanding common stock, Microsoft may have first and last rights of refusal to purchase \\nthe stock. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of NVIDIA, discourage proxy contests, and make it \\nmore difficult for shareholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they \\ndesire.\\nItem 1B.

Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\xa0\\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction \\nwith “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary \\nstatements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold, or sell \\nshares of our common stock.\\xa0\\nOverview\\nOur Company and Our Businesses\\nNVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Since our original \\nfocus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by \\nthe sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU \\narchitecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, and digital twin applications.\\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 16  of the Notes to the \\nConsolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in \\nDelaware in April 1998.\\nRecent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\\nDemand and Supply\\nRevenue growth in fiscal year 2025 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated \\ncomputing and AI solutions. Demand for our Hopper architecture drove our significant growth for the full year. We began \\nshipping production systems of the Blackwell architecture in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025. \\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or \\nsupply levels. We may not be able to generate significant revenue from them. Advancements in accelerated computing \\nand generative AI models, along with the growth in model complexity and scale, have driven increased demand for our \\nData Center systems.\\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand \\nprojections and increasing complexity of our data center products. With these additions, we have also entered and may \\ncontinue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. The \\nincreased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain creates \\nmore complexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our \\nexpanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We \\nhave incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity \\ncommitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\\nProduct Transitions and New Product Introductions\\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our \\nchannel partners prepare to ship and support new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the \\narchitectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional Visualization, and Automotive products. The computing industry is \\nexperiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set \\nof AI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we \\nseek to complete new computing solutions each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The \\nincreased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product configurations may magnify the \\nchallenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. The \\nincreased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could \\nincrease inventory provisions, warranty, or other costs or result in product delays. We incur significant engineering \\ndevelopment resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact our ability to develop other \\nproducts or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase \\nthe frequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the \\ntiming of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product transitions and have sold multiple \\nproduct architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and \\nimpact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.\\nGlobal Trade\\nIn August 2022, the USG announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China \\n(including Hong Kong and Macau) and Russia of our A100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX or any other systems or \\nboards which incorporate A100 or H100 integrated circuits.\\n36'),\n",

On October 23, 2023, the USG informed \\nus that the licensing requirements were effective immediately for shipments of our A100, A800, H100, H800, and L40S \\nproducts (removing the grace period granted by the official rule). Blackwell systems, such as GB200 NVL 72 and NVL 36 \\nas well as B200 are also subject to these requirements and therefore require a license for any shipment to certain entities \\nand to China and Country Groups D1, D4 and D5, excluding Israel. To date, we have not received licenses to ship these \\nrestricted products to China. Additionally, we understand that partners and customers have also not received a license to \\nship these restricted products.\\nWe expanded our Data Center product portfolio to offer new solutions, including those for which the USG does not \\nrequire a license or advance notice before each shipment. We ramped new products designed specifically for China that \\ndo not require an export control license. Our Data Center revenue in China grew in fiscal year 2025. As a percentage of \\ntotal Data Center revenue, it remains well below levels seen prior to the onset of export controls in October 2023. The \\nmarket in China for datacenter solutions remains competitive. We will continue to comply with export controls while \\nserving our customers. To the extent that a customer requires products covered by the licensing requirements, we may \\nseek a license for the customer but have no assurance that the USG will grant such a license, or that the USG will act on \\nthe license application in a timely manner or at all.\\nOn January 15, 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance \\nperiod, the IFR will, unless modified, impose a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export \\nControl Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software \\nand technology. Any system that incorporates one or more of the covered integrated circuits, or ICs, (including but not \\nlimited to NVIDIA DGX, HGX, and MGX systems) will be covered by the new licensing requirement. The licensing \\nrequirement will include future NVIDIA ICs, boards, or systems classified with ECCN 3A090.a or 4A090.a, or \\ncorresponding .z ECCNs, achieving certain total processing performance and/or performance density.\\nUnless a license exception is available, the worldwide licensing requirements will apply to the following NVIDIA products, \\nand any others we develop that meet the characteristics of 3A090.a or 4A090.a, including but not limited to: A100, A800, \\nH100, H200, H800, B100, B200, GB200, L4, L40S, and RTX 6000 Ada. \\nOur competitive position has been harmed by the existing export controls, and our competitive position and future \\nresults may be further harmed, over the long term, if there are further changes in the USG’s export controls. Given the \\nincreasing strategic importance of AI and rising geopolitical tensions, the USG has changed and may again change the \\nexport control rules at any time and further subject a wider range of our products to export restrictions and licensing \\nrequirements, negatively impacting our business and financial results. In the event of such change, we may be unable to \\nsell our inventory of such products and may be unable to develop replacement products not subject to the licensing \\nrequirements, effectively excluding us from all or part of the China market, as well as other impacted markets, including \\nthe Middle East and countries designated “Tier 2” by the AI Diffusion IFR. In addition to export controls, the USG may \\nimpose restrictions on the import and sale of products that incorporate technologies developed or manufactured in \\nwhole or in part in China. For example, the USG is considering restrictions on the import and sale of certain automotive \\nproducts in the United States, which if adopted and interpreted broadly, could impact our ability to develop and supply \\nsolutions for our automotive customers.\\nWhile we work to enhance the resiliency and redundancy of our supply chain, which is currently concentrated in the Asia-\\nPacific region, new and existing export controls or changes to existing export controls could limit alternative \\nmanufacturing locations and negatively impact our business. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to \\nRegulatory, Legal, Our Stock and Other Matters” for a discussion of this potential impact.\\nMacroeconomic Factors\\nMacroeconomic factors, including\\u202f inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain \\nconstraints, tariffs, and global economic and geopolitical developments, may have direct and indirect impacts on our \\nresults of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic \\nfactors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our \\ninvestments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within \\nour supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors.\\n37'),\n",

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments \\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of \\ncontingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty \\nand could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Our inventory and capacity purchase \\ncommitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand and consider our third-party manufacturers' lead times \\nand constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve \\nmonths for some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of \\nour historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to \\nother market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and \\nmacroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products.\\nRefer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further \\ndiscussion.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is \\nbased on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. \\nOur estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an \\nanticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or \\nchanges in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax \\ncontingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine \\nthat payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may \\nbe required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be \\nrealized based on all available evidence. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, \\nwe would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon \\naudit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to \\nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue Allowances\\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for \\nestimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if \\nproduct returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional \\nsales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain \\nstocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. \\nFor shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based \\non applicable facts and circumstances.\\nWe account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, or MDFs, as a reduction in \\nrevenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer \\nprograms include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes \\nwhich require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program \\naccruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal \\nand external factors.\\nLicense and Development Arrangements\\nRevenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services \\nare performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as \\na percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project \\nincludes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable.\\n39\"),\n",

Judgement is required in determining whether each \\nperformance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, \\nNVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or \\ninterdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered \\ndistinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.\\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple \\nperformance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis.  In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling \\nprice based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar \\ncustomers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service \\nseparately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs.\\nResults of Operations\\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2025  compared to fiscal year 2024  \\nis presented below.

We carry the Notes at face value less \\nunamortized discount on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The \\nimpact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years \\n2025  and 2024 .\\nSales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, \\ntherefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to \\nother currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. \\nConversely, decreases in the value of the United States’ dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers \\nraising their manufacturing costs.\\nIf the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January\\xa026, 2025  and January\\xa028, 2024 , the amount recorded in accumulated \\nother comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been $136 \\nmillion and $116 million lower, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) \\nwould be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized.\\nIf an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have \\nresulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of $129 million and $60 million as of January\\xa0 26, 2025  and \\nJanuary\\xa0 28, 2024 , respectively.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our \\nmanagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the \\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January\\xa0 26, 2025  based on the criteria set forth in \\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway \\nCommission.

In \\nfiscal year 2022, we began an upgrade of our ERP system, which will update much of our existing core financial systems. \\nThe ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records used to report operating results. The upgrade will \\noccur in phases. We will continue to evaluate each quarter whether there are changes that materially affect our internal \\ncontrol over financial reporting.\\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure \\ncontrols and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well \\nconceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system \\nare met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the \\nbenefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, \\nno evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within \\nNVIDIA have been detected.\\n46'),\n",

We also have audited the Company's internal control \\nover financial reporting as of January 26, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework \\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial \\nposition of the Company as of January 26, 2025 and January 28, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows \\nfor each of the three years in the period ended January 26, 2025 in conformity with accounting principles generally \\naccepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective \\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 26, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - \\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\\nBasis for Opinions\\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal \\ncontrol over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, \\nincluded in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our \\nresponsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal \\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company \\nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in \\naccordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange \\nCommission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of \\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was \\nmaintained in all material respects.\\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material \\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that \\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and \\ndisclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used \\nand significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated \\nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal \\ncontrol over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design \\nand operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such \\nother procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis \\nfor our opinions.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the \\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and \\nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the \\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are \\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting \\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of \\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely \\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the \\nfinancial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \\nAlso, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become \\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \\ndeteriorate.\\n50\"),\n",

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our \\nopinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit \\nmatter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it \\nrelates.\\nValuation of Inventories - Provisions for Excess or Obsolete Inventories and Excess Product Purchase Commitments\\nAs described in Notes 1, 9 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company charges cost of sales for \\ninventory provisions to write-down inventory for excess or obsolete inventory and for excess product purchase \\ncommitments. Most of the Company’s inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products, based on the \\nCompany’s inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand \\nand market conditions. As of January 26, 2025, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $10.1 billion and the \\nCompany’s consolidated outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations balance was \\n$30.8 billion, of which a significant portion relates to inventory purchase obligations.\\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of inventories, \\nspecifically the provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, is a critical audit \\nmatter are the significant judgment by management when developing provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and \\nexcess product purchase commitments, including developing assumptions related to future demand and market \\nconditions. This in turn led to significant auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and \\nevaluating management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions.\\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our \\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls \\nrelating to management’s provisions for excess or obsolete inventories and excess product purchase commitments, \\nincluding controls over management’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. These procedures \\nalso included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the provisions for excess or obsolete \\ninventories and excess product purchase commitments; evaluating the appropriateness of management’s approach; \\ntesting the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approach; and evaluating the reasonableness of \\nmanagement’s assumptions related to future demand and market conditions. Evaluating management’s assumptions \\nrelated to future demand and market conditions involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were \\nreasonable considering (i) current and past results, including historical product life cycle, (ii) the consistency with external \\nmarket and industry data, and (iii) changes in technology.\\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\\nSan Jose, California\\nFebruary\\xa026, 2025\\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2004. \\n51'),\n",

All share, equity award, and per share amounts \\nand related shareholders' equity balances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.\\nFiscal Year\\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2025 , 2024  and 2023  were all 52-\\nweek years.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All \\nintercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and \\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities \\nat the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. \\nActual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those \\nrelated to accounts receivable, cash equivalents and marketable securities, goodwill, income taxes, inventories and \\nproduct purchase commitments, investigation and settlement costs, litigation, non-marketable equity securities, other \\ncontingencies, property, plant, and equipment, restructuring and other charges, revenue recognition, and stock-based \\ncompensation. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are \\nreasonable.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, \\nsoftware licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification \\nof the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the \\ntransaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is \\nallocated on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the \\nstandalone selling price for each performance obligation); and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a \\nperformance obligation. Payment from customers, per our standard payment terms, is generally due shortly after delivery \\nof products, availability of software licenses or commencement of services.\\nProduct Sales Revenue\\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects \\nthe consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an \\nextended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are \\nrecognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for \\nreturns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for \\nestimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if \\nproduct returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional \\nsales return allowances are required to accurately reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.\\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in \\nvarious target markets, and MDFs which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment \\ndevelopment and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for \\ncustomer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for such programs for potential rebates and MDFs based on the \\namount we expect to be claimed by customers.NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n57\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'F:\\\\Multi-User Document Search and Conversational Q&A System\\\\data\\\\Nvidia\\\\NVIDIA-2025-Annual-Report.pdf'}, page_content='License and Development Arrangements\\nOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our IP \\ncomponents. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a \\nsingle performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to \\ncompletion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each \\nproject. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.\\nSoftware Licensing\\nOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. \\nCustomers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over \\nwhich the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with support, which includes \\nthe right to receive, on a when-and-if available basis, future unspecified software updates and upgrades. Revenue from \\nsoftware licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. Software support revenue \\nis recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.\\nCloud Services\\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software and hardware infrastructure without taking possession of \\nthe software or hardware, are provided on a subscription basis or a combination of subscription plus usage. Revenue \\nrelated to subscription-based cloud services is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud \\nservices based on usage is recognized as usage occurs. Cloud services are typically sold on a standalone basis, but certain \\nofferings may be sold with hardware and/or software and related support.\\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\\nOur contracts may contain more than one of the products and services listed above, each of which is separately \\naccounted for as a distinct performance obligation. We account for multiple agreements with a single customer as a \\nsingle contract if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely \\nrelated that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.\\nWe allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in an arrangement with multiple \\nperformance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis.  The standalone selling price reflects the price we \\nwould charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. \\nWhen determining standalone selling price, we maximize the use of observable inputs.\\nProduct Warranties\\nWe offer a limited warranty to end-users ranging from one to three years  for products to repair or replace products for \\nmanufacturing defects or hardware component failures. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product \\nwarranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an \\nextended limited warranty to customers for certain products. We also accrue for known warranty and indemnification \\nissues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\\nStock-based Compensation\\nWe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant, minus a dividend yield discount, as the fair \\nvalue of awards of restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs, that are based on our corporate \\nfinancial performance targets. We use a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of PSUs \\nthat are based on our stock performance compared to market performance, or market-based PSUs. The compensation \\nexpense for RSUs and market-based PSUs is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the requisite \\nemployee service period while compensation expense for PSUs is recognized using an accelerated amortization model \\nbased on performance targets probable of achievement. We estimate the fair value of shares to be issued under our \\nemployee stock purchase plan, or ESPP, using the Black-Scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in \\nMarch and September of each year. Stock-based compensation for our ESPP is expensed using an accelerated \\namortization model. Additionally, for RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs, we estimate expected forfeitures based on our \\nhistorical forfeitures.\\nLitigation, Investigation and Settlement Costs\\nWe currently, are, and will likely continue to be subject to claims, litigation, and other actions, including potential \\nregulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, \\ncompetition and antitrust, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters. \\nThere are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigation, and we cannot be certain that these actions \\nor other third-party claims against us will be resolved without litigation, fines and/or substantial settlement payments or \\njudgments. If information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation, NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n(Continued)\\n58'),\n",

However, the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our \\nestimates, which could require us to record additional costs. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the \\nloss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss.\\nForeign Currency Remeasurement\\nWe use the U.S. dollar as our functional currency for our subsidiaries. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are \\nremeasured into United States dollars at end-of-period exchange rates. Non-monetary assets and liabilities such as \\nproperty and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured \\nat exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to non-monetary balance sheet \\namounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are \\nincluded in earnings in our Consolidated Statements of Income and to date have not been significant.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe recognize federal, state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or \\nrefundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or \\nliabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; \\nand we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on \\navailable evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing \\nwith uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change \\nbased, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in \\nthe U.S., or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize \\nliabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to \\nwhich, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax \\nliability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income \\ntax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\\nAs of January\\xa026, 2025 , we had a valuation allowance of $1.6\\xa0billion  related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state \\nand other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional \\nprojections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes \\nmore-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period.\\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon \\naudit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to \\nunrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.\\nNet Income Per Share\\nBasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the \\nperiod. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive \\nshares outstanding during the period, using the treasury stock method. Any anti-dilutive effect of equity awards \\noutstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\\nWe consider all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and have an original maturity of three \\nmonths or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Marketable securities consist of highly liquid debt \\ninvestments with maturities of greater than three months when purchased and publicly-held equity securities. We \\nclassify these investments as current based on the nature of the investments and their availability for use in current \\noperations.\\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities at the date of acquisition as available-for-sale. These \\navailable-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in \\naccumulated other comprehensive income or loss, a component of shareholders’ equity, net of tax. The fair value of \\ninterest-bearing debt securities includes accrued interest. Realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities \\nare determined using the specific-identification method and recorded in the Other income (expense), net, section of our \\nConsolidated Statements of Income.\\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities are subject to impairment review. If the estimated fair value of available-for-sale debt \\nsecurities is less than its amortized cost basis, we determine if the difference, if any, is caused by expected credit losses \\nand write-down the amortized cost basis of the securities if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n(Continued)\\n59'),\n",

Allowances for credit losses and write-downs are \\nrecognized in the Other income (expense), net section of our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nPublicly-held equity securities have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in Other income \\n(expense), net.\\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair \\nvalues due to their relatively short maturities as of January\\xa026, 2025  and January\\xa028, 2024 . Marketable debt and equity \\nsecurities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices . Derivative instruments are recognized as either \\nassets or liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on \\nthe intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For fair value hedges, the gains or losses are recognized \\nin earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting losses or gains on the hedged items attributed to the \\nrisk being hedged. For derivative instruments designated as accounting hedges, the effective portion of the gains or \\nlosses on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss and is subsequently \\nrecognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as \\naccounting hedges, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings.\\nConcentration of Credit Risk\\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, \\nmarketable securities, and accounts receivable. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly-rated fixed income \\nsecurities, the diversification of investment type and credit exposures, and includes certain limits on our portfolio \\nmaturities. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and maintain an allowance for \\npotential credit losses. This allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on \\noverall estimated exposure. Our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of \\ncredit.\\nInventories\\nInventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis, which approximates actual cost on an average or first-in, first-\\nout basis. Inventory costs consist primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing \\nand packaging, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test \\nyield fallout, and shipping costs, as well as the cost of purchased memory products and other component parts. We \\ncharge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for \\nobsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to \\nexcess quantities of products, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to \\nassumptions about future demand and market conditions. Once inventory has been written-off or written-down, it \\ncreates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written-up. We record a liability for noncancelable \\npurchase commitments with suppliers for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with our \\nvaluation of obsolete or excess inventory.\\nProperty and Equipm ent\\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is \\ncomputed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets of two to seven years . Once \\nan asset is identified for retirement or disposition, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are \\nremoved, and a gain or loss is recorded. The estimated useful lives of our buildings are up to thirty years . Depreciation \\nexpense includes the amortization of assets recorded under finance leases. Leasehold improvements and assets recorded \\nunder finance leases are amortized over the shorter of the expected lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset .\\nLeases\\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 \\nmonths are included in operating lease assets, accrued and other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease \\nliabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the \\nlease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments over the lease term.\\nOperating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments \\ndiscounted using our incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease assets also include initial direct costs incurred and \\nprepaid lease payments, minus any lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease \\nwhen it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over \\nthe lease term.NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n(Continued)\\n60'),\n",

We currently amortize our \\nintangible assets with finite lives over periods ranging from one to twenty years  using a method that reflects the pattern \\nin which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern cannot be \\nreliably determined, using a straight-line amortization method.\\nLong-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for \\nimpairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group \\nmay not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets or asset groups to be held and used is measured by a comparison of \\nthe carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated \\nby the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an \\nimpairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the \\nestimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash \\nflows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. Assets and liabilities to be disposed of would be separately \\npresented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the assets would be reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair \\nvalue less costs to sell, and would no longer be depreciated .\\nBusiness Combination\\nWe allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and \\nintangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over \\nthe fair values of these net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Management’s estimates of \\nfair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but our estimates and assumptions are inherently \\nuncertain and subject to refinement. The estimates and assumptions used in valuing intangible assets include, but are not \\nlimited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows, discount rate used to determine the present value of \\nthese cash flows and asset lives. These estimates are inherently uncertain and, therefore, actual results may differ from \\nthe estimates made. As a result, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, we may \\nrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the \\nmeasurement period's conclusion or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition, \\nwhichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nAcquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred.\\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\\nNon-marketable equity securities consist of investments in privately-held companies that do not have a readily \\ndeterminable fair value. These investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, and are adjusted for changes \\nresulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer, \\nor the measurement alternative. Fair value is based upon observable inputs in an inactive market and the valuation \\nrequires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. All gains and losses on these \\ninvestments, realized and unrealized, are recognized in other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of \\nIncome. \\nWe assess whether an impairment loss has occurred on our investments in non-marketable equity securities, accounted \\nfor under the measurement alternative based on quantitative and qualitative factors. If any impairment is identified for \\nnon-marketable equity securities, we write down the investment to its fair value and record the corresponding charge \\nthrough other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statements of Income.NVIDIA Corporation and Subsidiaries\\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\\n(Continued)\\n61\"),\n",

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and \\ncertain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange \\nAct, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact \\nof cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018.

Plaintiffs sought class \\ncertification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including \\nattorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district \\ncourt granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and \\nclosed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the \\nNinth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part \\nand reversed in part the district court’s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district \\ncourt did not err in dismissing the case.

To find the profit, we would need to know the total revenue and expenses for each segment, which are not explicitly stated in the given context. However, the income from operations (before accounting for expenses) for the Family of Apps segment in 2024 is $87,109 million, so their profit (if there's a surplus) would be at least that amount if there were no other expenses. For the Reality Labs segment, there's a loss of ($17,729) million in 2024. Therefore, the total profit for both segments combined would be $69,380 (Family of Apps income) - ($17,729) (Reality Labs loss) = $51,669 million. Keep in mind that this is an approximation as we don't have the full financial information to account for other expenses and potential losses in the Family of Apps segment or gains/losses in other areas.\n",
